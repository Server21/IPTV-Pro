Your task is to select suitable personalities for various jobs and load them into clones.

1. Choose a profession.
2. Use influences to match personality traits with job traits as closely as possible. You can choose from 1 to 5 influences.
3. Assess how well the personality fits the job.
Use the color of attributes as an indicator:
&lt;pos=30%&gt;Green - full match.
&lt;pos=30%&gt;Yellow - partial match with a deviation of 5 points.
&lt;pos=30%&gt;Black - no match.

4. Click “Apply”.
You will be rewarded if three or more bulbs light up.

  <string id="7052">Par for the course, Evan. Punishments are clearly stated in Clause 12 of the Ministry Job Referral.</string>
  <string id="7054">“Important positions entail elevated levels of responsibility”, or something like that.</string>
  <string id="7056">But it's savage and barbaric! Everyone was clapping!</string>
  <string id="7058">Did you think your job was going to be a walk in the park? It's a nest of vipers, Evan. And you must become the goddamn king of the vipers if you want to get promoted!</string>
  <string id="7060">So you're saying I should plot against my colleagues? Sneak around, frame them, blackmail them, drive them to suicide?</string>
  <string id="7062">So you’re saying that all's fair in war? Is there any other way?</string>
  <string id="7066">And I care about what kind of person I'll be after such a “victory”.</string>
  <string id="7068">You always have a choice, Evan.</string>
  <string id="7070">Hello, Evan. Did you find out anything interesting from Hemnitz?</string>
  <string id="7072">I didn't get the chance, James. He was hanged at the meeting today! Just like that!</string>
  <string id="7074">It was just horrible! Everyone started clapping! How could that happen?!</string>
  <string id="7080">It’s very suspicious. Did anyone overhear your conversation?</string>
  <string id="7082">No, he refused to talk in the Ministry; we spoke near the statue of the Leader.</string>
  <string id="7084">A good, yet clearly useless, precaution. There are ears all over the Ministry, down to the last brick.</string>

  <string id="14746">Remember you told me about that self-development workshop? It was a revelation! I realized that I’d been living my whole life wrong! I had the wrong job, did things I didn't want to do, loved the wrong people!</string>

  <string id="15087">Good choice!</string>
  <string id="15092">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="15113">Ask where you can buy useful items</string>
  <string id="15119">Why are you here, Redgrave? I’m not your boss anymore. Go back to your own floor, and stop distracting me from my work.</string>
  <string id="15121">Glad to see you, Evan. I heard you got promoted. I hope you won't forget about your friend when you reach the very top.</string>
  <string id="15154">Lure him into DeSalvo's office</string>
  <string id="15158">Suggest he take part in the quiz</string>
  <string id="15162">Hi there. I can make you an offer you won't refuse!</string>
  <string id="15166">I don't!</string>
  <string id="15168">Comrade DeSalvo was looking for you. He asked you to come to his office.</string>
  <string id="15170">Sorry, I have no idea who that person is, or where he works.</string>
  <string id="15172">I don't know him.</string>
  <string id="15174">I'd love to, but the guidelines won't let me!</string>
  <string id="15176">I see. Sorry!</string>
  <string id="15262">Would you like to take part in the quiz?</string>
  <string id="15264">What’s that?</string>
  <string id="15266">Well, there’ll be questions about the country, the Leader and such. You need to answer them.</string>

  <string id="5011">Someone at 8 Krushvice Street is always breaking one of the lamps! On behalf of all the tenants, we ask you to resolve this problem!</string>
  <string id="5012">Unknown persons have desecrated my shed!</string>
  <string id="5013">Desecrated your shed?</string>
  <string id="5014">Yes, sir. There were a lot of highly valuable household items in there! This is outrageous and must be stopped immediately!</string>
  <string id="5015">What must be stopped?</string>
  <string id="5016">What do you mean “what”? The misuse of diligent workers’ property to serve one’s own base needs!</string>
  <string id="5017">Someone has graffitied the walls of our building! The culprits must be lined up against the same walls and shot!</string>
  <string id="5018">Have they besmirched the name of our Glorious Leader? Or disrespected our military victories?</string>
  <string id="5019">Worse! They drew the sun and some ducks! Rubber ducks! I blame the parents! You have to do something about this flagrant misbehavior.</string>
  <string id="5020">I live near the weapons factory. Some small people regularly meet up on the wasteland behind the building and fly kites.</string>
  <string id="5021">Small people? Do you mean children?</string>
  <string id="5022">They might be children. But they could also be spies from South Borea pretending to be children so that they can take photos of the factory! Boreans are small, aren't they? I demand that you detain them all!</string>
  <string id="5023">I'm the building manager... er... former building manager of No. 3 Great Legacy Street. Yesterday there was a military training exercise going on nearby, and a shell accidentally landed... in the wrong place.</string>
  <string id="5024">Twenty-eight people died, including two children. Surely that’s a crime? I want you to... find the perpetrators, if that’s possible...</string>
  <string id="5025">Hello! I would like to report a repeated violation of Directive No. 8750 at the city cemetery.</string>
  <string id="5026">8750 bans unauthorized rallies, right?</string>
  <string id="5027">It does! Every day, groups of people come to the cemetery to give speeches of a pessimistic nature and do other suspicious things. They’re easy to spot - they’re always wearing black.</string>
  <string id="5028">And they always have a coffin with them. Presumably to use as cover.</string>
  <string id="5029">I would like to report a crime. Some miscreants hijacked my mobile propaganda unit. They’re driving around the city broadcasting some nonsense about freedom and democracy.</string>
  <string id="5030">I have no ties to freedom, and especially not to democracy! I respect the criminal code! I want that put on the record. And I want you to find and punish the culprits!</string>
  <string id="5031">Someone is always unscrewing the light bulbs at the entrance to our building. I should point out that I am the junior secretary to the head of the third department of the Bureau of Statistics!</string>
  <string id="5032">What if I break my leg in the dark? This is obviously an act of malice and sabotage!</string>
  <string id="5033">Hello! I would like to report that unknown criminals opened three sealed-off apartments in our building and took everything of value.</string>
  <string id="5034">Greetings! I’m an archivist in the military archive. I recently discovered that carpenters' reports about coffins for the Front were not marked as “confidential” - thus violating Directive No. 8790 of the Ministry of Order!</string>
  <string id="5035">This must be corrected urgently, before anyone else uncovers this information!</string>
  <string id="5036">What do you propose?</string>
  <string id="5037">Do I really have to spell it out for you? Find whoever took receipt of these reports and have them executed for negligence! It's obvious!</string>
  <string id="5038">A respectful hello to you! I would like to report that the management of our plant is criminally delaying the introduction of X-ray equipment to the entrance checkpoint in accordance with Ministry of Order Directive No. 5765 .</string>
  <string id="5039">They say it's because of high radiation levels, but what’s wrong with that? I’ve seen for myself that whenever people use it, they positively glow with happiness at how safe they are!</string>
  <string id="5040">Those mobile propaganda units in the streets make far too much noise! We’ve had far too many cases of shattered windows!</string>
  <string id="5041">Do you have something against propaganda?</string>
  <string id="5042">Me? Don't say that! I understand the importance of boosting patriotic sentiment! But is it possible to reduce the volume a bit?</string>
  <string id="5043">What are the youth of today supposed to think? Who among them would want to serve in an army where they can't even spell the word “execution” properly?</string>
  <string id="5044">Get to the point, please.</string>
  <string id="5045">Yesterday I found a typo on the new posters calling for people to defend the Motherland from traitors. It's unacceptable!</string>
  <string id="5046">The electricity went out during the most recent performance of “Real Patriots Eat Turnips” at the Red Torch Theater. The actors couldn't finish their performance.</string>
  <string id="5047">The youngsters who came along to feel a sense of enlightenment and unity with the Motherland left disappointed. I demand a comprehensive investigation into this incident.</string>
  <string id="5048">A huge propaganda poster was put on our building as part of the preparations for a military parade. It covered up everyone’s windows.</string>
  <string id="5049">After the parade, the poster was just left there. It's unacceptable to leave honest workers with no sunlight!</string>
  <string id="5050">A few days ago, another group of dead soldiers was buried in the city cemetery. As usual, one of the coffins was draped in the flag of our great Motherland.</string>
  <string id="5051">But they forgot to remove it, and buried it like that. I think everyone who allowed the burial of our symbol must be punished severely!</string>
  <string id="5052">Stop printing the portrait of our Great Leader in the weekly newspaper.</string>
  <string id="5053">Do you have something against our Leader?</string>
  <string id="5054">Not at all! But you see, since the entire paper industry switched to printing propaganda literature, our country has been suffering a shortage of adsorbent.</string>
  <string id="5055">-&gt;$7234</string>
  <string id="5056">Toilet paper. As a result, newspapers are generally used for... “hygiene”. And if there’s a picture of the Leader taking up the whole page, it can get... awkward...</string>
  <string id="5057">Whoever authorized the production of “Leader” branded condoms must be punished! He is the rock-hard shaft around which our society is built, and he deserves the proper respect!</string>
  <string id="5058">I used my shoe voucher at Store No. 3. The shoes I bought have a quality stamp on the soles featuring the state coat of arms.</string>
  <string id="5059">Who thought to put a sacred symbol in such a place? People are trampling all over our coat of arms! The saboteurs must be found and punished!</string>
  <string id="5060">Yesterday at work we had a rally in support of Directive No. 6738. Everyone got a badge with a picture of the Leader - everyone except me. How can I explain it to my kids?</string>
  <string id="5061">That their father, a decorated cesspit emptier of Quarter 31, isn’t worthy of a badge? I need you to sort out this shortage of badges for honored members of society!</string>
  <string id="5062">I have a subscription to a series of books chronicling the Leader's speeches. Page 429, paragraph 3 of the latest volume mentions Simeon Koldyrin, who was exposed as a traitor last week!</string>
  <string id="5063">Are the authors suggesting that our Leader associates with criminals? I demand that all the culprits be punished and every copy of this seditious book destroyed!</string>
  <string id="5064">There’s a billboard on the main avenue with a quote from the Leader: “Glory to all that benefits us - whatever it may be!”.</string>
  <string id="5065">If you stand on the opposite side of the street, it reads: “!eb yam ti revetahw - su stifeneb taht lla ot yrolG”.</string>
  <string id="5066">It distorts the meaning of this glorious phrase! All traffic on that side of the road must be outlawed immediately!</string>
  <string id="5067">I want to complain about the mobile propaganda units near my apartment building.</string>
  <string id="5068">Don't you like propaganda?</string>
  <string id="5069">I don't like that they only operate during the daytime! I’ve spoken with the drivers - they don't want to work at night, but many of our tenants work night shifts and need to hear the truth, too!</string>
  <string id="5070">How will people sleep at night then?</string>
  <string id="5071">What does it matter? The enemy never sleeps, after all! These propaganda unit drivers must be held accountable for their laziness and lack of patriotic responsibility! I demand that they be punished!</string>
  <string id="5072">Hospital No. 3 serves patients soup made with rotten onions! You have to stop this disgraceful practice!</string>
  <string id="5073">My son's classmates are always making fun of him. I think it's because of his dietary requirements - he's lactose intolerant.</string>
  <string id="5074">But there have been practically no dairy products in schools since the Cattle Decree.</string>
  <string id="5075">That doesn’t mean that he can’t tell everyone how unique and special he is! He practices raw veganism - I’m so proud of him!</string>
  <string id="5076">Food shortages have made half the population raw vegans...</string>
  <string id="5077">I'm sorry, what?</string>
  <string id="5078">Never mind. Give me a minute. I'll find the office you need.</string>
  <string id="5079">Someone painted the benches in the park, but didn’t bother to hang up any signs about it.</string>
  <string id="5080">My clothes were ruined, and my jacket got stuck to a bench! I hope this misunderstanding will be straightened out soon.</string>
  <string id="5081">Rent is costing more and more, but my apartment building isn’t getting any better. I won’t stand for it! The place is a disgrace - there’s only so much falling plaster a person can take!</string>
  <string id="5082">We've gone through several managers and none of them have done anything.</string>
  <string id="5083">I haven't been able to collect my pension in two months - all just because someone with the same name died. Who can help me?</string>
  <string id="5084">Hello! Yesterday I went to the hospital to get my disability certificate extended. They said that you’re only classed as disabled if you’ve lost your right hand - not your left, like I have!</string>
  <string id="5085">It’s an outrage! The hospital management must be punished for abusing its power!</string>
  <string id="5086">Hello! There's a shed by our building where the caretaker’s been keeping brooms and things like that for years. Recently, some degenerates and their kids shacked up in there, saying that they have nowhere to live!</string>
  <string id="5087">I want to find out what they’re up to and evict them!</string>
  <string id="5088">I recently spent some time at a health resort, and I would like make a complaint about the staff. I'm a general in the Logistics Service and I’m entitled to Class A1 accommodation. But what did I get?</string>
  <string id="5089">The bedsheets were changed every two days, there was no cream for my coffee at breakfast, and caviar was only served at dinner! This will not stand!</string>
  <string id="5090">Why should war heroes such as myself have to live in such inhuman conditions? We've spilled our blood in the offices, and for what?!</string>
  <string id="5091">I want to report inappropriate behavior by the management of Orphanage No. 3. They put the children to work in the orphanage vegetable garden, supposedly because they haven’t been allocated any rations.</string>
  <string id="5092">I don’t get any either, but they won’t let me into their garden! Either they should be forbidden from keeping a vegetable garden, or forced to admit everyone! As the Leader says: “One war - one vegetable patch!”.</string>
  <string id="5093">None of us at Depot No. 4 have been paid in three months! We can only afford to eat rice and fish - it’s unbearable. Something has to be done!</string>
  <string id="5094">I want to make a complaint against Trade Trust No. 3. They refused to hire me in the import deliveries department! What an outrage! They say there’s already a waiting list of two hundred candidates.</string>
  <string id="5095">I don't care! I want a job there!</string>
  <string id="5096">Something must be done about the publications in the Labor Happiness newspaper. There have been no vacancies published in three months, and instead they run advertisements for mopeds!</string>
  <string id="5097">What the hell do I need a moped for if I can't find a job?! It seems to me that someone in the editorial office is abusing their position and ignoring their job responsibilities.</string>
  <string id="5098">I came to complain about the management of Foundry No. 2. Our equipment is always breaking down, and nobody even considers lowering production quotas while its being repaired!</string>
  <string id="5099">Are we expected to pour molten metal by hand? All they keep saying is that they don't set the quotas and can't change them. Something must be done!</string>
  <string id="5102">I want to complain about the terrible working conditions in the police force. Who the hell decided that we have to wear hats underneath our helmets? What genius thought it would be a good idea to boil our brains?</string>
  <string id="5103">But the hats provide extra cushioning from attackers!</string>
  <string id="5104">If anyone ever hit me on the helmet, it would be the last time they hit anything. Now I have a sweaty bald spot all day! This can’t be allowed to continue!</string>
  <string id="5105">I want to complain about the city utilities management. They only hire North Borean immigrants!</string>
  <string id="5106">The janitors are Boreans, the road workers are Boreans, the cleaners are Boreans! I recently visited North Borea and there was hardly anyone left there. They've overrun us!</string>
  <string id="5107">I want to report that last weekend, a group of five unknown people armed with tools carried out repairs on Kindergarten No. 78, also known as “Little Leader”.</string>
  <string id="5108">Isn't that a good thing?</string>
  <string id="5109">They left my whole organization without any work! We've been preparing for this repair job for seven years! We have 300 employees! What are they all supposed to do now? Something has to be done about this!</string>
  <string id="5110">I want to file a complaint! Our despicable enemies derailed a performance by my Youth Drummers in honor of the Battle of the Pzhista River!</string>
  <string id="5111">What enemies are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="5112">The trumpet section! Those blowhards greased up my guys' drums with fish oil!</string>
  <string id="5113">My wife has been driving me up the wall since she watched a family movie called “Together Forever”. She’s asking for flowers and other silly stuff like that. She’s been crying for days and acting crazy.</string>
  <string id="5114">Measures must be taken against such films!</string>
  <string id="5115">I was hit by a puck during a hockey match and lost three teeth!</string>
  <string id="5116">While you were playing?</string>
  <string id="5117">No, while I was watching! What’s more, I was the only spectator. There are absolutely no safety measures in place in the stands! It’s outrageous! I want to file a complaint!</string>
  <string id="5118">Everyone knows that our country is the best in the world. Our national track and field team was sent to the World Championships to remind other countries of this fact.</string>
  <string id="5119">Those useless parasites didn't win a thing. Even worse, not all of them came back! I suggest, no, I demand that they be sent to the gold mines, seeing as they obviously can't get any in competitions!</string>
  <string id="5120">Some new musical instruments were recently delivered to our House of Culture. They’re awful! The string instruments don’t stay in tune, it’s impossible to blow into the wind instruments, and the piano keys don’t work!</string>
  <string id="5121">And it's all because they were made at a furniture factory! The people responsible should be sent to cut down trees, not butcher musical instruments!</string>
  <string id="5122">I recently attended a music festival in support of the war effort. I’m outraged! It was an insult to the memory of our fallen comrades!</string>
  <string id="5123">Have you heard what they’ve been singing? “Let The War Be Over!”. Who put this program together? Who even allowed these talentless hacks to appear on a stage? Whoever is responsible for this disgrace must be punished!</string>
  <string id="5124">What up, coach! Yesterday my football team played against the police team - The Sheriffs. Over the course of the match they arrested ten players for exceeding the pedestrian speed limit!</string>
  <string id="5125">Their goalkeeper gave us a fine right there on the field! I want to file a complaint about the referees for their behavior. And I want a rematch!</string>
  <string id="5126">I would like to complain about the manufacturers of my team’s sports equipment. Those tightwads have got some nerve! Look at the underpants and tank tops they made for us! Two scraps of cloth!</string>
  <string id="5127">There's shortage of cloth because of the war.</string>
  <string id="5128">But we're a ski team!</string>
  <string id="5129">Do you see this disgraceful display?</string>
  <string id="5130">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="5131">This theater program! While the whole country is working hard for the war effort, these buffoons are using up precious paper on their useless programs!</string>
  <string id="5132">The theater management must be punished for their wastefulness!</string>
  <string id="5133">You do realize that this is an international scandal, don’t you?!</string>
  <string id="5134">Pardon?</string>
  <string id="5135">I would hope that you recognize me. I'm Enrico Peruso! I was promised the largest venue for my concert, but when I arrived in the city I discovered that it's being used as a field hospital!</string>
  <string id="5136">I've given shows for the Leader! I have a year of performances lined up! I need to see whoever is responsible for this catastrophe immediately!</string>
  <string id="5137">No. In fact, I don't even want to see them. Just execute them!</string>
  <string id="5138">Vandals! Barbarians! Philistines!</string>
  <string id="5139">-&gt;$5634</string>
  <string id="5140">I want you to dedicate all your resources to finding whoever vandalized the poster for my show: “The Mines are Calling!”. Look at me! Do I have a mustache and a beard in real life? Or horns?</string>
  <string id="5141">And this postscript “... you to the grave” after the title?! You have to bring these villains to justice!</string>
  <string id="5142">Greetings! The management of the theater where I work has increased actors’ productivity quotas. Now we have to perform for fourteen hours a day! Even when the hall is empty and there are no shows on!</string>
  <string id="5143">The Ministry should sort this out and put the director and his lackeys back in their place!</string>
  <string id="5144">I invented an incredible device that can make all our lives easier. But Construction Department No. 6 refuses to accept it!</string>
  <string id="5145">What kind of device?</string>
  <string id="5146">Proprietary Equipment for Notation, Sketching and Letter-writing - P.E.N.S.L. for short. This innovative tool has a graphite core for improved performance!</string>
  <string id="5147">So you invented... a pencil?</string>
  <string id="5148">Are you one of them, too?! That’s exactly what they said at the Construction Department... You don't understand anything! I want to make a complaint!</string>
  <string id="5149">I read the book “Physics For Everyone” and now I can't sleep!</string>
  <string id="5150">And what is the actual appeal you want to make?</string>
  <string id="5151">This book says that classical mechanics and quantum mechanics don't operate under the same laws. But in our Great Country, everyone lives and works under the same laws!</string>
  <string id="5152">This is an outrage! I demand that the authorities force these scientists to develop a unified theory of physics!</string>
  <string id="5153">The experimental pressure cooker I bought yesterday exploded in my kitchen when I switched it on! Now all the walls are covered in my signature thyme and tomato soup!</string>
  <string id="5154">And what would you like to do?</string>
  <string id="5155">I want you to punish everyone involved in the invention of this thyme bomb!</string>
  <string id="5156">After watching “Do It Yourself” on TV, my wife decided to make a ceiling fan out of matches, acorns and an old spring. Would you be at all surprised to hear that it was a failure?</string>
  <string id="5157">The power is out in the whole building. And now there's a spring sticking out of my wall! I kindly ask you to punish the inventors of such dangerous creations!</string>
  <string id="5158">An experimental new field pesticide was delivered to our economic union recently.</string>
  <string id="5159">After using it, the pests continued to destroy our crops as if nothing ever happened. But workers who came into contact with it started acting strange.</string>
  <string id="5160">They've become uncommunicative and excessively patriotic. I want to know just what kinds of pests and fields these chemicals were designed for.</string>
  <string id="5161">And whoever suggested conducting human trials should be punished!</string>
  <string id="5162">Greetings. I demand that you find the person who spat in my dish!</string>
  <string id="5163">I understand how unpleasant that must be, but we have more serious issues to deal with...</string>
  <string id="5164">My issue is more serious than yours! Someone spat in my Petri dish and undid ten years of my hard work!</string>
  <string id="5165">I was supposed to attend a mathematics symposium, but the Institute sent some upstart junior researcher instead!</string>
  <string id="5166">All he did was prove some theorem! I have 30 years of scientific experience! I demand that the administration of the Institute be punished for their disrespectful attitude towards valuable employees such as myself!</string>
  <string id="5167">Hello! I'm a physics teacher at the Mining University. Yesterday I left some calculations on the blackboard, and when I came in today I saw that the board had been wiped!</string>
  <string id="5168">The culprit must be found and punished!</string>
  <string id="5169">I've come with a report on theft-prevention measures at Door Handle Factory No. 8.</string>
  <string id="5170">Here are the full vandalism statistics for the Coal Park area over the last quarter. Who should I hand them over to?</string>
  <string id="5171">I've brought a journal listing every instance of light bulb theft at the entrance to our apartment building, and of graffiti appearing on the walls.</string>
  <string id="5172">It also describes preventative measures taken and the dates the crimes were committed. I hope it will help with the investigation into these flagrant violations of law and order.</string>
  <string id="5173">I've brought the minutes of the workers’ meeting at Mine No. 7 after receiving complaints about some of their behavior. They’d set up an after-hours fight club.</string>
  <string id="5174">I'm the manager of the tenement building at 7 Strasheci Street. Here are profiles of all my tenants.</string>
  <string id="5175">I've brought a report on how we’ve met our quota for uncovering saboteurs at our kindergarten.</string>
  <string id="5176">Kindergarten?</string>
  <string id="5177">Yes! Arrests in the younger group for violations of Directive No. 92873 are up by 300% this month alone! We've had to start new children's groups twice already. Do you reckon there's a reward for that?</string>
  <string id="5178">Hello! I did what they asked of me.</string>
  <string id="5179">-&gt;$12022</string>
  <string id="5180">I was recently called in by the police... They asked me about my wife. I’ve already said everything I know! I swear I didn't ever think she...</string>
  <string id="5181">-&gt;$5688</string>
  <string id="5182">Sorry... So, they told me to try and remember who that traitor could have communicated with before her arrest. Here's all the information I have.</string>
  <string id="5183">I brought the list of employees from my factory who want to join the voluntary city patrols under Directive No. 5873.</string>
  <string id="5184">There are so many of them!</string>
  <string id="5185">Why are you so surprised? As our Great Leader says: “Being a volunteer is a sacred duty!” And we fully support him!</string>
  <string id="5186">I want to report on the number of schoolchildren who visited patriotic camps this summer.</string>
  <string id="5187">I'm from the Propaganda Bureau. Here are all the student essays from my district on the topic of “How I Love the Wise Leader” for linguistic analysis.</string>
  <string id="5188">The Special Commission is satisfied with the results of the guitar concert dedicated to the love of our Motherland. I've brought all the lyrics and chords in order to compile a patriotic songbook.</string>
  <string id="5189">I brought you a trial copy of the Monochrome Star newspaper so it can be verified for patriotism.</string>
  <string id="5190">I want to thank everyone involved in the “From the Heart” patriotic song festival at Mine No. 4. The songs even made the walls shake! Who should I give the award recommendation list to?</string>
  <string id="5191">I'm the supervisor of a public toilet by the railway station. Each stall is equipped with a surveillance camera and a microphone, in accordance with the Patriotism Law.</string>
  <string id="5192">I've brought you all the video and audio recordings for this month.</string>
  <string id="5193">I have our factory’s anti-optimism activities report, in accordance with the latest directive from the Ministry of Patriotism.</string>
  <string id="5194">Hello! I've managed to cultivate a new kind of apple tree that bears fruits the colors of our national flag! I want to give the seedlings to the state biological collection.</string>
  <string id="5195">Hello. I have a list of tenants from our building who want to participate in the annual Parade of Future Victory.</string>
  <string id="5196">Just two people?</string>
  <string id="5197">Yes, me and my wife. My mother-in-law turned us down, and we couldn’t find anyone else.</string>
  <string id="5198">At long last, there are cycle paths in Labor Park. And while it isn’t possible to buy bicycles at the moment, I would like to thank everyone involved. This is a big step forward for our country!</string>
  <string id="5199">-&gt;$5716</string>
  <string id="5200">Where do I submit the completed family trees for the population census?</string>
  <string id="5201">I have all the required documents to obtain a voucher for a trip to a health resort. Where do I hand them in?</string>
  <string id="5202">I’ve assembled all the paperwork to prove that there are multiple children in my family.</string>
  <string id="5203">Greetings! My wife is a typist in the Ministry of Order. In accordance with Ministry of Social Care Directive No. 8869 regarding the relatives of public servants, I've brought my income records for the last year, my employment certificate, excerpts from the tenants’ register and my medical records.</string>
  <string id="5204">I was told to bring a statistical reference regarding military service housing for veterans. Here it is.</string>
  <string id="5205">I have profiles of all the children at the kindergarten where I work, complete with photos and distinguishing characteristics.</string>
  <string id="5206">Everything's been done in strict accordance with form No. 23, as requested. Now I hope we'll be able to get those new potties - the old ones are useless.</string>
  <string id="5207">I've brought an in-depth log detailing my daily observations of my colleagues. It includes all of their absences and the exact time spent taking smoke breaks.</string>
  <string id="5208">I want to submit a list of my plant's employees and their figures for the last month. The top workers are highlighted in red, the lazy ones in gray.</string>

  <string id="5213">I have been instructed to provide the Ministry of Labor with a performance and loss report.</string>
  <string id="5214">I've brought work efficiency estimates for the fourth quarter of this year. They’re in line with the goals set by the Ministry of Labor: a 125% output increase, a 30% salary decrease, and a one-hour increase of the working day.</string>

  <string id="5217">Hi there! I have a doctor's note saying that I can't work in the mines.</string>
  <string id="5218">My father said he found me a job at the Central Bank, but this Ministry of Distribution of yours keeps sending me summonses!</string>
  <string id="5219">I have a report on the pregnancy statistics for clothing factory workers, and the effect it has on production and performance.</string>
  <string id="5220">I’m about to blow my top! I won't be kept waiting here a minute longer! Who here needs a list of my barge's crew?</string>
  <string id="5221">A lot of ‘em didn’t come back from the last voyage, as happens, but the rest are greedy swines! Remember that when you're giving out ration cards!</string>
  <string id="5222">I have the annual instrument renewal plan for the Houses of Culture. Who should I give it to? In total, we're charging for 2,143 drums, 1,876 trombones, 2 triangles and 1 grand piano.</string>
  <string id="5223">I’m here to submit the new posters for the theatrical production of “We’re the Happiest - Don’t Believe the Traitors” for censorship. Who do I give them to?</string>

  <string id="5235">I want to present the Ministry with my chemical formula for transforming gold into lead. Which office should I go to?</string>
  <string id="5236">I had a dream about some new fundamental particles and had to draw them right away. The quarks and muons are sketched in pencil, and the leptons and bosons are in charcoal because my pencil ran out.</string>
  <string id="5237">I'd like to donate my works to assist our fundamental physicists!</string>
  <string id="5238">I have some data on the flammability of various materials. It can be used to calculate the amount of fuel needed to burn counterfeit and prohibited items in accordance with the relevant directives. Which office should I bring it to?</string>

  <string id="5244">My wife says that they're a complete waste and keeps threatening to throw them away. So I decided to hand them over to our trusted Ministry of Science!</string>
  <string id="5245">True scientists will be able to appreciate my work.</string>
  <string id="5246">Hello! I am a veterinarian. I’ve noticed that cows that listen to the Leader's speeches demonstrate a sharp increase in milk production, pigs give birth to more piglets, and sheep’s wool becomes softer and silkier!</string>
  <string id="5247">I would like to pass these observations on to the Ministry of Science. They might be of use to the Academy of Agriculture.</string>
  <string id="5248">I want to inform you that my brother-in-law is keeping forbidden books. I know for a fact that he reads them under a blanket with a flashlight.</string>
  <string id="5249">His name?</string>
  <string id="5250">Klaus Schimmer. He's wasting precious batteries on reading this crap. Even worse, his work is suffering because he’s not getting enough sleep! Put an end to this!</string>
  <string id="5251">I want to make a statement. My mother-in-law steals cotton candy from work and takes it home.</string>
  <string id="5252">Not only are we sharing our home with criminal, but the cotton candy isn’t even sweet! And we get itchy every time we eat it!</string>
  <string id="5253">Her name and place of work?</string>
  <string id="5254">Claudia Biman. She works at the thermal insulation factory.</string>
  <string id="5257">I would like to report Irvin Borzhovich, my neighbor's kid.</string>
  <string id="5258">What’s this boy done to you?</string>
  <string id="5259">He has a part-time job shining shoes. And he deliberately pours mud all around the entrance to our building so that he gets more clients! It's fraudulent business practice! Stop him!</string>
  <string id="5260">I have something urgent to report! Listen! I’ve witnessed a terrible future crime in progress!</string>
  <string id="5261">Go on.</string>
  <string id="5262">There's an apple tree close to our building.</string>
  <string id="5263">So...</string>
  <string id="5264">So, I was walking past it one day.</string>
  <string id="5265">And...</string>
  <string id="5266">And you of all people must know about the recent directive banning apples! Do you realize what could happen?! You have to stop this tree from committing a crime!</string>
  <string id="5267">So if I understand you correctly, you want us to arrest an apple tree?</string>
  <string id="5268">This apple tree is a criminal with heinous plans for future lawbreaking! Hurry up, we don’t have much time!</string>
  <string id="5269">Hello! My name is Nikolai Meser. I'm 39, single, and recently started working as a chemistry teacher at School No. 217.</string>
  <string id="5270">The principal, Johannes Brahms, is always playing the piano between classes. This is a violation of clause 3 of subparagraph 7 of article 9 of Directive No. 097809.</string>
  <string id="5271">And while I have the utmost respect for him, I'm afraid he must be executed. Who do I report this to?</string>
  <string id="5272">My neighbor has fat lips!</string>
  <string id="5273">Sorry?</string>
  <string id="5274">I said that my neighbor, Victor Krause, has big, fat, glistening lips!</string>
  <string id="5275">And what would you like me to do about that?</string>
  <string id="5276">Are you an idiot? It clearly means that he’s been eating sausages, which, as you know, have not been manufactured in this country for three years.</string>
  <string id="5277">So they must be contraband sausages! He's a criminal and should be arrested!</string>
  <string id="5278">I want to report a violation of Directive No. 6729 from June 23 this year. My neighbor, Jacob Proust, is hiding a draft dodger in his home. Someone who was called to serve on the Western Front.</string>
  <string id="5279">The fact that the man in question is Jacob's son doesn’t give him the right to violate directives, does it?</string>
  <string id="5280">Hello! I want to report a breach of the law. The writer Mark Niemeyer, who lives at 3 Leader's Wisdom Street, is trying to leave the city without an official certificate of absence.</string>
  <string id="5281">How do you know that?</string>
  <string id="5282">Because I have the certificate! I accidentally entered his room when he wasn't at home and saw it just lying there in a closed drawer!</string>
  <string id="5283">So, of course, I took it. You can't leave documents like that lying around! And his resort voucher was dated for today, so he must have left without his certificate!</string>
  <string id="5284">I want to report that one of the typists at our bureau, Martha Zane, is a spy! I sometimes see her pick up a newspaper, read it, then underline something in it.</string>
  <string id="5285">And that makes her a spy?</string>
  <string id="5286">Of course it does! Her accomplices in South Borea are sending her encrypted terrorist commands in the personal column.</string>
  <string id="5287">Young man! I've worked as a watchman for twenty years! My intuition has never failed me!</string>
  <string id="5288">Lieutenant Richter reporting, sir! Captain Weller spent funds allocated for bribing South Boreans on gambling and loose women!</string>
  <string id="5289">Dietrich Schultz, the manager of Building No. 4 on Responsibility Street, has opened an underground casino.</string>
  <string id="5290">I demand that someone put an end to this illegal activity and refund all the money I lost!</string>
  <string id="5291">I want to complain about Ivan Felmeyer, the director of our lab. We have no chemicals, no test tubes, no equipment - nothing!</string>
  <string id="5292">These are hard times.</string>
  <string id="5293">Are “hard times” the reason why he blew the entire budget on a trip to a resort with the assistant girl? Felmeyer should be punished for embezzlement!</string>
  <string id="5294">I would like to inform you that the physicist Maurice Hecker has assembled a radio receiver from old equipment, and uses it to listen to forbidden South Borean stations at night.</string>
  <string id="5295">That’s punishable by being sent to the labor camps!</string>
  <string id="5296">Hi! I'd like to report that Professor O’Callaghan has flagrantly violated the Standards for Processing Classified Data!</string>
  <string id="5297">When did this happen?</string>
  <string id="5298">-&gt;$13379</string>
  <string id="5299">And what exactly did he do?</string>
  <string id="5300">That’s also classified.</string>
  <string id="5301">Pass my message on to the Ministry of Order! You can use Directive No. 98720... It prescribes everything from financial rewards to execution, so it's up to you to decide!</string>
  <string id="5302">I want to let you know that a couple of the peddlers on Labor Square, Bertha Proschek and Anna Hobbes, have been feeding stale bread to the pigeons! Those damn birds have befouled the statue of our Great Leader! It's deeply offensive!</string>
  <string id="5303">Yesterday Charles Stobart's bakery was selling cakes with the Wise Leader's face on them! This is completely unacceptable!</string>
  <string id="5304">Explain.</string>
  <string id="5305">What is there to explain?! I can't even bring myself to say it... People have been cutting up and... and eating our Leader! It's so unpatriotic and vile! Stobart has to be arrested!</string>
  <string id="5306">I wish to inform you that my colleague James Aderhold's kids graffitied a poster our Wise Leader by scrawling a moustache over it!</string>
  <string id="5307">This is an insult to my patriotic sensibilities. The Leader already has a full and majestic moustache! The insinuation that it can be replaced or improved upon is treasonous! I suggest arresting Aderhold, and shipping his kids off to the labor camps!</string>
  <string id="5308">My neighbor, Joshua Krukov, makes inappropriate jokes about our Leader when he's drunk!</string>
  <string id="5309">What kind of jokes?</string>
  <string id="5310">For example, an infinite number of Leaders walk into a bar...</string>
  <string id="5311">Are you insane? Are you trying to get exiled?</string>
  <string id="5312">There's a joke about that, too. It goes...</string>
  <string id="5313">Stop it at once, before you get us both into... Whew... Let me see where to send you...</string>
  <string id="5314">This is unforgivable! Last night some vandals put a hat and gloves on one of the statues of our Great Leader!</string>
  <string id="5315">It was Zlata Ushtek and Veselina Krenek from the textile factory! They must be punished!</string>
  <string id="5316">My neighbor, Damir Kadapidi, didn't stand for the national anthem at a recent football game.</string>
  <string id="5317">I saw Samuel Harris, the shift manager at my plant, change the channel from our Leader's speech to a morning workout!</string>
  <string id="5318">And then he made all the workers exercise, instead of letting them soak up every word of our Leader's wisdom!</string>
  <string id="5319">My neighbor's kid, Ben Crivens, was spitting paper at a portrait of the Leader. He used wadded-up pages from a newspaper featuring a portrait of the Leader!</string>
  <string id="5320">That's two crimes in the space of a minute! He's a hardened juvenile criminal who needs to be put behind bars at once!</string>
  <string id="5321">Luke Parker, my neighbor, beats his wife every day, and blasts out the national anthem on his turntable to drown out the sounds!</string>
  <string id="5322">That's none of my business, of course, but as a professor at the academy of music, I must report that he consistently misses the beat - especially during the chorus!</string>
  <string id="5323">One can't show such disrespect to state symbols - it offends my patriotic sensibilities!</string>
  <string id="5324">Look at this herring!</string>
  <string id="5325">What's wrong with it?</string>
  <string id="5326">Look at what it's wrapped up in!</string>
  <string id="5327">A newspaper?</string>
  <string id="5328">Not just any newspaper! It's yesterday's issue, which has one of the Leader's speeches on the front page!</string>
  <string id="5329">But this is the last page. The one with the crosswords and puzzles.</string>
  <string id="5330">That's not the point! I demand that Luis Barton, the fishmonger, be arrested for showing such flagrant disrespect to our Leader!</string>
  <string id="5331">I live by the city square. My neighbor, Otto Brandis, goes around feeding paint to the pigeons. Says it's to cheer people up, but c’mon! Everyone knows that the rainbow contains the colors of the enemy’s flag!</string>
  <string id="5332">I'm here to report my kid's kindergarten teacher. Charlotte Shepard's her name. She lets the kiddos sit on the potty when the anthem's on. That’s teaching them to be traitors, right?</string>
  <string id="5333">My building manager, Max Staff, uses a bust of our Great Leader to crack nuts!</string>
  <string id="5334">-&gt;$5739</string>
  <string id="5335">My neighbor, the designer Peter Bless, said yesterday that our coat of arms looks like an upside-down pyramid!</string>
  <string id="5336">Yesterday, Johannes Bloom, the projectionist at the Victory movie theatre, played a South Borean comedy called “A Blond Guy and His Girls” instead of our patriotic war drama, “War Is Never Far!”.</string>
  <string id="5337">Even though it's War Drama Month at the theater!</string>
  <string id="5338">One of the teachers in State Kindergarten No. 159, Brigitte Swen, isn’t looking after the children properly.</string>
  <string id="5339">How exactly?</string>
  <string id="5340">My son keeps coming home sniffling and covered in bruises! There are only 95 kids in the class - how hard can it be to keep an eye on them?</string>
  <string id="5341">I want her prosecuted for neglecting the future of our Great State!</string>
  <string id="5342">Stefan Oswald, a professor in the Coal Mining Faculty, won't let my kid enrol.</string>
  <string id="5343">Says his grades aren't up to par, and ignores the fact that my boy can tell soft coal from graphite or anthracite by taste alone!</string>
  <string id="5344">Oswald deserves to be punished as harshly as possible.</string>
  <string id="5345">Maurice Walsh, the head of Hospital No. 2, doesn't keep his facility in proper sanitary condition. The patient rooms are dirty, there's mold in the showers, and the kitchen's overrun with cockroaches the size of a bulldog!</string>
  <string id="5346">What’s more, yesterday my nephew slipped in the hallway where they dump the bedpans and broke his arm!</string>
  <string id="5347">These are gross violations according to the standards published by Epidemiological Control last year! The only solution is his dismissal and arrest.</string>
  <string id="5348">I'd like to file a complaint against Klenz Mnetis. He’s a high school teacher, and he doesn’t know a thing about what he's teaching.</string>
  <string id="5349">I flicked through my son's notebook, and was shocked - it was full of letters! There wasn’t a number in sight! And this is math we're talking about. Do something!</string>
  <string id="5350">Rene Helfenburg, our physician, keeps prescribing me the same medicine for everything. Doesn't matter if I have headaches, a cough, a runny nose, allergies...</string>
  <string id="5351">Every time he just tells me to take aspirin. I believe he's unqualified for his position.</string>
  <string id="5352">Alternative medicine offers tons of different herbs and tinctures and the like! Replace him with someone who takes a more modern, educated approach!</string>
  <string id="5353">I want to report that my neighbor has too much living space and our building manager, Oscar Morel, has done nothing about it!</string>
  <string id="5354">It's already been two weeks since my neighbor’s wife and three kids got run over, and there's still nobody living in their rooms!</string>
  <string id="5355">-&gt;$5752</string>
  <string id="5356">Don't you think we should be punishing the families of traitors?</string>
  <string id="5357">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="5358">It's been two weeks since Nikolai Landau was declared a traitor and sent to the mines, and Alan Morino, the manager of the Grocery store, keeps sending bread to the guy’s family!</string>
  <string id="5359">He says he doesn't want the children starve to death, even though we all know our Ministry of Social Care won't let anyone die without proper authorization.</string>
  <string id="5360">I demand the arrest of Alan Morino for interfering with the state welfare program!</string>
  <string id="5361">I want to report Franz Dietrich, building manager of No. 67-bis on Veterans' Drive. There are illegals living in his business apartment: his brother's wife, his three nephews and one of his grandmothers. He says they have nowhere else to go because his brother was killed in the war, but I say rules are rules!</string>
  <string id="5362">I'm here to fulfil my civic duty and report a violation of the Family Code.</string>
  <string id="5363">Yesterday, I went to get a trim at the Leader's Mustache barber shop, and witnessed George Mandyuk, the hair services specialist, kiss another male in full view of the public! This is unacceptable. How can the Ministry allow this?</string>
  <string id="5364">Who was the other male?</string>
  <string id="5365">That’s not important. I mean, it was his son, but citizens are forbidden from engaging in oral contact with members of the same sex! So, I’ll say it again: how can the Ministry of Social Care allow this?</string>
  <string id="5366">I have to report that my boss, Gus Morev, is a tyrant! He makes us workers bring him tea and polish his boots - what the hell?! It's illegal and disgraceful!</string>
  <string id="5367">You must arrest Philippe Courier, the milk truck driver, for dereliction of duty! He's supposed to pour unsold milk into the gutter, but instead he's been giving it to stray cats!</string>
  <string id="5368">Jiri Shnip, my boss, has jeopardized the reputation of our rubber plant! We used to make tires, but when demand fell we switched to police batons.</string>
  <string id="5369">And now he says we'll be making ducks! Rubber ducks! Please don't allow him to embarrass our plant!</string>
  <string id="5370">I need a new job.</string>
  <string id="5371">What's wrong with your current job?</string>
  <string id="5372">Well, you see, my wife is the boss. My ex-wife, I should say. And ever since we got divorced, she's been abusing her position to make my life hell.</string>
  <string id="5373">She makes me work overtime, she triples my quotas and then slashes my bonuses for not meeting them...</string>
  <string id="5374">I'll see about getting you reassigned.</string>
  <string id="5375">Smoking has always been prohibited at our fuel and lubricant depot. But now the new boss, Shiber Patek, says it's okay. And he lets his nephew sell smokes in the depot.</string>
  <string id="5376">Now everyone smokes, and I'm sweating bullets the whole time expecting a fire or an explosion. We have to stop this, before it's too late!</string>
  <string id="5377">I want to inform you that my neighbor, Walter Gauss, is a chronic freeloader! He thinks he's a poet, so he doesn't have a job... He just spends his days wasting perfectly good paper.</string>
  <string id="5378">Under Directive No. 8989, all citizens must serve at least ten hours a week in the defense of our Great Country. And how does Gauss spend his time? Scribbling worthless rhymes!</string>
  <string id="5379">I wanna say that Nicholas Pergheim, the warden of the prison, is violating guards’ rights and making the job real crappy!</string>
  <string id="5380">-&gt;$6088</string>
  <string id="5381">Says wardens can't take inmates' stuff after executions! The Great Leader himself gave us this privilege!</string>
  <string id="5382">My colleague, Martha Kramer, has created a hostile work environment! She keeps opening the window, and now I've got a stuffy nose all the time!</string>
  <string id="5383">Punish her, or at least prohibit her from opening the window. Or get a hammer and nails and do something!</string>
  <string id="5384">To your colleague?</string>
  <string id="5385">To the window! Though I like your idea, too - I'd be a shoe-in for that promotion. Can you make it happen?</string>
  <string id="5388">I'm here to report that citizen Franz Merezhkovsky is cheating the Ministry of Labor. He was assigned to be a radio host but instead, he records his voice at home and then plays the recording while working as a handler at the coal warehouse!</string>
  <string id="5389">Lola Thmin, the singer, caused a whole scandal after her performance on Railroad Worker Day. We invited her to our canteen... She took all the food with her, called us pathetic, and then she and the director of the House of Culture left together in his car!</string>
  <string id="5390">She should be punished for such thoughtlessness!</string>
  <string id="5391">Do something about the director of the Bumpy Roads theatre group! They hire disabled actors, then torture them to make their performances more realistic! One guy had both his eyes taken out by a parrot!</string>
  <string id="5392">What's the director's name?</string>
  <string id="5393">Mira Rosenblatt. She also uses the orchestra pit for her production of Spartans and their Problem Children. Throws those poor actors right at the trumpeters!</string>
  <string id="5394">The coach of our turnery's handball team refuses to give reserve players a chance to play in matches!</string>
  <string id="5395">He says he won't risk losing games by letting armless guys on the court!</string>
  <string id="5396">But you know what, we think a few missing fingers here and there are no reason to be a bad sport about it!</string>
  <string id="5397">Your coach's name?</string>
  <string id="5398">Herman Martino. Everyone wants to see him prosecuted!</string>
  <string id="5399">The national chess champion is a cheater who belongs in jail!</string>
  <string id="5400">Who? What happened?</string>
  <string id="5401">Luka Zhambek. He stole one of my pieces from the board during a match! And I already had all my moves written down!</string>
  <string id="5402">Modern theatre productions are shameful! I was at one recently, and it's an outrage how perversely they twisted the story of our Great Leader's life!</string>
  <string id="5403">And they renamed him “Hamlet” or some nonsense like that! This offends me as a citizen and a patriot. I demand that you arrest the director, Nikolai Redstroop.</string>
  <string id="5404">Hello, my name is Pierre Vaneau, and I'm a bellboy at the Anthracite Hotel. I thought you should know that Ricky Martinos, the famous singer, has been behaving in an antisocial manner!</string>
  <string id="5405">Orgies, girls, drinking every night! He's the Golden Voice of our people! Shame on him!</string>
  <string id="5406">Hello there! I want to report that Alex Podransky, the runner, has refused to take vitamins recommended by our doctors because they contain pervitin!</string>
  <string id="5407">Pervitin?</string>
  <string id="5408">Yes, you know, it’s just a harmless little stimulant - it puts a spring in your step. Everyone takes it, and he’s jeopardizing our team's chances for the world championships!</string>
  <string id="5409">I wish to notify the Ministry of Culture and Sports that the director of the Roots folk ensemble, Philip Kim, refuses to incorporate songs recommended by the Ministry of Culture into the band's routine.</string>
  <string id="5410">He claims that in days gone by, there were no Leader, Party, or War, which is why there's no mention of them in songs from that time period. What is that even supposed to mean? That kind of talk is criminal, pure and simple!</string>
  <string id="5411">Hello there! Tell me, please, are green apples still banned in our country?</string>
  <string id="5412">Yes, that directive has not been rescinded.</string>
  <string id="5413">Then I have a complaint. Darij Lucius from the circus has been juggling banned produce!</string>
  <string id="5414">It’s a slap in the face of our great people - the great people who years ago made the patriotic decision to tolerate red apples only!</string>
  <string id="5415">Hello, I want to report negligence on the part of Dmitry Petrashek, the movie editor.</string>
  <string id="5416">He used archive footage in his last documentary, the one about General Lampard's funeral.</string>
  <string id="5417">And what's wrong with that?</string>
  <string id="5418">Nothing, except that at one point General Lampard is seen carrying his own coffin! It strains the film’s credibility somewhat...</string>
  <string id="5419">Hello. I'd like to report an incident that occurred yesterday at an evening with the poet Albert Grabowski. While he was performing the Pacifist Hymn, the audience erupted in a completely unsanctioned uprising - they literally rose up out of their seats!</string>
  <string id="5420">What?</string>
  <string id="5421">A standing ovation! I'll have you know, the Public Events Attendance Guide lists all the approved reasons for standing up, and there’s no mention of Grabowski poems in there!</string>
  <string id="5422">I demand that he be punished for using the medium of poetry to cause such an outrage!</string>
  <string id="5423">Hello. I bought a book of Victor Grum's poems recently, and you know what? It doesn’t contain a single line about the working man! Nothing! It's all women, children, nature...</string>
  <string id="5424">What of the miner's labor? Or the risks of the police officer’s job? What about the irreplaceability of the civil servant?</string>
  <string id="5425">I want him kicked out of the Writers Guild, his typewriter confiscated, and his poems about love banned!</string>
  <string id="5426">I'm a technical consultant at a glass ceramics producer. I want you to punish my wife, Grace Chilton, for altering my designs at night without my knowledge.</string>
  <string id="5427">It’s beside the point that she has a college degree and I don't. And it’s also beside the point that her alterations are an improvement. It hurts my pride!</string>
  <string id="5428">Sean Campton, a process engineer at Bakery Plant No. 7, came up with a conveyor belt improvement that saves a lot of working time.</string>
  <string id="5429">First of all, now the workers have a ton of downtime they waste on who-knows-what!</string>
  <string id="5430">And even worse, he won't share his invention with me, even though I'm his supervisor!</string>
  <string id="5431">I demand his arrest for breaking the chain of command and intentionally impeding technological progress in the field of soft breads!</string>
  <string id="5432">I'm here to inform you that my neighbor's brother has made some kind of futuristic, next-generation inhaler.</string>
  <string id="5433">Now their room always smells like burning rags, they giggle non-stop, and they won't invite me over to join in!</string>
  <string id="5434">I demand that you confiscate this groundbreaking device, transfer ownership of it to me, and punish my neighbor and his brother for suppressing such an important invention!</string>
  <string id="5435">Their names?</string>
  <string id="5436">Dylan and James Brooke.</string>
  <string id="5437">I want to complain about my neighbors, Werner von Gray and Sergey King. There used to be an elevator in our apartment building. It broke some years ago.</string>
  <string id="5438">There was no money to fix it, so we left it be. Recently, these two neighbors acquired some kind of motor and decided to repair the elevator.</string>
  <string id="5439">But during one of their trial runs, the elevator gained too much speed and shot right through the roof. Now it leaks when it rains. But even that didn't stop them.</string>
  <string id="5440">They've scheduled another attempt for tomorrow. I request that you order von Gray and King to repair the roof, and to get rid of that motor before it's too late.</string>
  <string id="5441">My upstairs neighbor, Mark Lipinec, is trying to irradiate me with waves of some kind! Now when I'm at home I have to wear a tinfoil hat all the time!</string>
  <string id="5442">I insulated the apartment, but the waves still get through sometimes, and I can see what he's trying to indoctrinate me with. Images of a future where everyone's happy without the Great Leader!</string>
  <string id="5443">Please help! I don't want this future!</string>
  <string id="5444">Our junior lab tech, Martin Clavel, is using a still to make moonshine, which he then consumes along with cucumbers from our experimental plantation! He shouldn't be allowed to do science!</string>
  <string id="5445">Hello, I want to inform you that the entomologist Salzberg has discovered a new species of butterfly. He named it Franciscus pulchritudo - which means “Francesca the Beauty”.</string>
  <string id="5446">-&gt;$5787</string>
  <string id="5447">The problem is that the New Biological Species Naming Guide clearly outlines the procedure for naming new species, and Francesca is the name of Salzberg's daughter who starved to death a few years ago.</string>
  <string id="5448">If everybody starts naming butterflies however they please, where will it end? I believe Salzberg should be prosecuted for violating proper procedure, and the butterfly should be renamed!</string>
  <string id="5449">Greetings! I'd like to report that Nikolai Greenberg is using foreign-made scalpels for tissue dissection.</string>
  <string id="5450">Yet Directive No. 5730 clearly states that only domestically-produced instruments may be used for cutting!</string>
  <string id="5451">Hi. I've invented a device that can identify dissidents in a crowd and highlight them to the police. One of our junior lab techs, Nikolai Petrescu, got into my office tonight and ruined everything!</string>
  <string id="5452">Now the device won't turn off, and without warning electrocutes anyone who’s taken bribes! We can't do anything! The director of the institute had to be rushed to hospital, and it nearly killed a police captain!</string>
  <string id="5453">We need you to arrest Petrescu at once and find out how to turn the machine off.</string>
  <string id="5454">Who's in charge here? You?</string>
  <string id="5455">I'm just a clerk. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="5456">I have an urgent message! Henry Klein, a self-taught inventor, has built a device in that can, in his own words, “split the atom”!</string>
  <string id="5457">And why is it urgent?</string>
  <string id="5458">I see you're not a physicist... Let's just say if he succeeds in turning it on, there won’t be anyone left to see what happens next! I mean come on, he made the reactor out of a barrel!</string>
  <string id="5459">I'm a Member of the Writers Guild. I'm working on a detective story at the moment, and I'd like access to the crime archives for the past ten years.</string>
  <string id="5460">-&gt;$5797</string>
  <string id="5461">I need a full version of the Criminal Code. Oddly, they won't let me check it out from the library without the Ministry's permission.</string>
  <string id="5462">What's odd about that?</string>
  <string id="5463">I believe it’s a good idea for citizens to know what's legal and what's not. Don't you? Ignorance of the law is never an excuse.</string>
  <string id="5464">The Criminal Code is updated every week. A new version will come out while you're still waiting to get the permit.</string>
  <string id="5465">Let's do it anyway. At least I’ll be able to read the previous version.</string>
  <string id="5466">I'd like to get a gun.</string>
  <string id="5467">A gun permit, you mean?</string>
  <string id="5468">No, I mean where do I get a gun?</string>
  <string id="5469">I'm the principal of School No. 3 at 12 Strasheci St. Where can I get information about how many of my students are criminals?</string>
  <string id="5470">Yesterday, the newspaper published some pictures of the most-wanted terrorists, and one of them looks exactly like me!</string>
  <string id="5471">My wife kicked me out, my parents have disowned me, and everyone is out to get me. It's a miracle I made it here at all! But I've done nothing wrong!</string>
  <string id="5472">Give me a letter verifying that I'm not a terrorist!</string>
  <string id="5473">Do you have a mole on your left buttock?</string>
  <string id="5474">-&gt;$5706</string>
  <string id="5475">Nothing, sorry.</string>
  <string id="5476">I heard that there was a terrorist attack at the port recently, and one of the suspects they arrested has the same surname as me.</string>
  <string id="5477">The thing is, my brother works there and I'm worried he's fallen in with the wrong crowd. I recently got a good job, and I can’t afford to be associated with a terrorist. How can I find out whether it's him or not?</string>
  <string id="5478">I need all felony vandalism cases from the past five years related to the Patience and Silence monument.</string>
  <string id="5479">I'm writing an essay on the effectiveness of our law enforcement agencies, and I want to demonstrate how much the number of prosecuted hooligans has grown!</string>
  <string id="5480">I'd like to talk to someone about my ideas for fighting terrorists more effectively.</string>
  <string id="5481">What kind of ideas?</string>
  <string id="5482">Baiting them. Do you know what I’m saying? We could carry out a couple of acts of terrorism, to set an example, then see who comes out to watch them!</string>
  <string id="5483">There will be terrorists among them! Like attracts like! It's pretty ingenious, don't you think?! I want to lead the operation! I’ve already written up a business plan!</string>
  <string id="5484">Hello. I read an article in the Military Science Bulletin about the analysis of the explosives used in the most recent act of sabotage at the plastics plant.</string>
  <string id="5485">Quite inventive, I must say! You see, those terrorists managed to synthesize a hitherto unknown compound with incredible explosive power!</string>
  <string id="5486">Are you a fan of theirs, then?</string>
  <string id="5487">By no means! I just wanted to ask the Ministry of Order to send the results of their interrogations to our lab. The address is No. 3-bis Construction Department No. 14/3. We'd like to have a look!</string>
  <string id="5488">I require assistance in arranging a rally dedicated to the upcoming birthday of our Great Wise Leader!</string>
  <string id="5489">I think my compatriots are starting to forget what a great country they live in.</string>
  <string id="5490">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="5492">I want to get a permit to read certain extracts of our Wise Leader's biography aloud on Patience Square and Obedience Drive.</string>
  <string id="5493">What for?</string>
  <string id="5494">To increase patriotism among our fellow countrymen!</string>
  <string id="5495">I wrote a romance novel based on the life of our Wise Leader. The Ministry of Agriculture says I should have it checked for patriotism.</string>
  <string id="5496">I'd like to see the standard regulations for depictions of the Leader in works of art.</string>
  <string id="5497">I need 300 wall calendars with pictures of the Great Leader for the upcoming year. They'll have a tremendous propaganda effect in our prison!</string>
  <string id="5498">I'm compiling a guidebook of all the monuments to the Great Leader in our city. I need information about their locations and how many of them there are.</string>
  <string id="5499">The head physician sent me here to get new stickers for the medicine labels in our hospital. This year, the only medicine we received was ribwort, but everyone knows how powerful the Leader's words are! They can raise the dead!</string>
  <string id="5500">I'd like the updated list of patriotic songs approved for performance in school music lessons. We were told it's been amended this week.</string>
  <string id="5501">I'd like data on our losses on the Western Front during the war.</string>
  <string id="5502">Are you sure you need that information?</string>
  <string id="5503">Of course! We were tasked with finding out how many heroes have given their lives for the Leader. The more losses, the more heroes, right?</string>
  <string id="5504">I'd like to thank everyone who helped erect a monument to the Leader on the roof of our building.</string>
  <string id="5505">Living under his heel, seeing how he looks down on us all... It's a lifelong dream come true! I need to know the names of the heroes responsible!</string>
  <string id="5506">I've brought a poem in praise of the Great Leader and our victorious deeds in the West. This patriotic masterpiece will stir up the whole country!</string>
  <string id="5507">I want to have it published in the next edition of the newspaper! Where can I leave it?</string>
  <string id="5508">I don't know what to do... You're my last hope!</string>
  <string id="5509">Tell me what happened.</string>
  <string id="5510">My daughter Zlata was hit by a car... She needs a kidney transplant... She's number 176 on the waiting list... My little girl is dying, and we have no money to move her up the list...</string>
  <string id="5511">Would you like to apply for medical assistance?</string>
  <string id="5512">Yes! I'm begging you... If my little girl dies, it’ll be the end of me!</string>
  <string id="5513">I need a wheelchair!</string>
  <string id="5514">Do you have any proof of your disability? You don't seem to be having any trouble getting around without a wheelchair.</string>
  <string id="5515">I don't! I just wanted to take part in the Third Annual Wheelchair Race. There are holiday resort vouchers up for grabs!</string>
  <string id="5516">You need to prove that you need a wheelchair.</string>
  <string id="5517">Are you saying I should become disabled just so that I can go to a seaside resort?</string>
  <string id="5518">No. I'm saying you won't get a wheelchair without a certificate proving that you need one.</string>
  <string id="5519">And where can I get that certificate?</string>
  <string id="5520">Just a minute...</string>
  <string id="5521">Me, my wife, and our three kids have nowhere to live.</string>
  <string id="5522">What happened to your previous residence?</string>
  <string id="5523">I sold it to pay a debt.</string>
  <string id="5524">-&gt;$9939</string>
  <string id="5525">Cards. I'd like to apply for a new apartment.</string>
  <string id="5526">I need to take maternity leave.</string>
  <string id="5527">But you're a man!</string>
  <string id="5528">Paternity, then. I need to get ready to become a father.</string>
  <string id="5529">My wife and I finally got a spot for our son at a kindergarten. It doesn’t matter that he's a 9th-grader now, it's still a nice feeling.</string>
  <string id="5530">Where do I need to go to transfer that spot over to our other kid, who's actually just about to start kindergarten?</string>
  <string id="5531">I took in a boy from the streets yesterday. He's very weak... Starved, sick, thin as a rake...</string>
  <string id="5532">I live alone, my wife is dead, my son is at war. I can't care for the kid. How can I get him into an orphanage?</string>
  <string id="5533">This year, my son was finally allocated a place in kindergarten, but he doesn’t need it anymore. How do I officially turn it down?</string>
  <string id="5534">Why do you want to turn it down?</string>
  <string id="5535">My son was killed in action three years ago. Kindergarten won't do him much good now.</string>
  <string id="5536">Can I collect my father's belongings? He turned 85 and we took him to the National Euthanasia Center yesterday, but the old loon decided to take grandpa’s gold watch in with him.</string>
  <string id="5537">That thing is my inheritance!</string>
  <string id="5538">I'd like to know when it'll be my turn to get free medicine. Last time I was at the doctor’s, she said that without medicine I won't last more than a couple of months. And I'm still number 3,267 on the list...</string>
  <string id="5539">Hi! I recently got promoted to the position of grade-4 clerk, so now I’m entitled to increased rations for groceries and manufactured goods.</string>
  <string id="5540">What documents do I need to bring in order to get them?</string>
  <string id="5541">I'd like to donate my body to science. I heard you can get money for it, and I need to pay for my son's education.</string>
  <string id="5542">You do realize that the payment is made... Well, after they... Receive your donation?</string>
  <string id="5543">I'll do anything for science. And I’ll do double that for my son! What forms do I need to fill out?</string>
  <string id="5544">Hi, I need Professor Zdanek's home address.</string>
  <string id="5545">We don't give out that kind of information to unauthorized individuals.</string>
  <string id="5546">I'm not unauthorized, I AM Professor Zdanek! I get a bit forgetful sometimes, and I can't seem to remember where I live.</string>
  <string id="5547">And how can I help you?</string>
  <string id="5548">I'd like the Ministry of Social Care to provide me with a note of my address. I'll put it in my passport, right next to my residence permit and housing information. That way, I’ll never lose it.</string>
  <string id="5549">I want to change my job!</string>
  <string id="5550">Why?</string>
  <string id="5551">Lately, a lot of places have taken to paying employees in the products they make - instead of money.</string>
  <string id="5552">And while it's an honor to serve our Great Motherland in the Sewage and Sanitation Union... You know... Can I be reassigned to the soap factory?</string>
  <string id="5553">I know how to make our country great again! I want to be a minister! Where do I apply?</string>
  <string id="5554">I would like to submit a request to register for a place on the waiting list for an annual salary increase.</string>
  <string id="5555">Your name and employer.</string>
  <string id="5556">Simon Atherton. I'm the junior assistant to a grade-3 senior deputy miner.</string>
  <string id="5557">I'd like to work for the Ministry of Order.</string>
  <string id="5558">Do you think you’re well-suited to that kind of work?</string>
  <string id="5559">Of course! I love beating people up!</string>
  <string id="5560">But that's not what the Ministry of Order does!</string>
  <string id="5561">Really? One of my old buddies from the fight club thinks different. Let me speak to someone who knows more about it than you do!</string>
  <string id="5562">I need a proof of income letter.</string>
  <string id="5563">Doing your taxes?</string>
  <string id="5564">I wish. My wife has demanded that I provide her with proof of my income every month, so she can manage our family budget. It was a mutual decision.</string>
  <string id="5565">I'd like to know what my grocery ration will be if I work three shifts?</string>
  <string id="5566">But three shifts is 24 hours.</string>
  <string id="5567">I'm only 40, I can handle it!</string>
  <string id="5568">Hi! I got a reassignment notice yesterday. It says I'll be packing boxes at the ammo plant.</string>
  <string id="5569">Do you think it's a mistake?</string>
  <string id="5570">Of course! I'm a qualified cardiac surgeon. Board-certified! What will working in a factory do to my fingers? I want to file for reassignment - at least to be a warehouse attendant!</string>
  <string id="5571">Hi. I’ve just graduated from mining college. What vacancies do you have in the mines?</string>
  <string id="5572">You’ve graduated from college and now you want to actually work IN the mines?</string>
  <string id="5573">I heard miners make more than engineers, and I have to feed my family and pay off my student loans.</string>
  <string id="5575">Hi, mister! I need a job!</string>
  <string id="5577">I can be a courier, a ratcatcher, a janitor! I really need a job... My sister got hit by a car, and we really need money.</string>
  <string id="5580">Hi! I need a referral for some career enhancement courses.</string>
  <string id="5581">What's your area of expertise?</string>
  <string id="5582">Don't have one, I'm unemployed. I just need a job. I call that “career enhancement”. Silly joke, I know.</string>
  <string id="5583">Hi! I've brought ID photos, my university diploma and a reference from my previous employer. Can I apply to be a janitor now?</string>
  <string id="5584">Hi! I want to patent a method of modernizing production and increasing the efficiency of our lathes by 5%!</string>
  <string id="5585">Wow, a whole 5%?</string>
  <string id="5586">Yes! If we electrify the lathes so that they electrocute their operators, they work faster! Here are my calculations - what should I do with them? </string>
  <string id="5587">Our great people have a bright fire burning in their hearts, but we need more music in our souls. I want to start a folk accordionists’ club. Where do I get a license?</string>
  <string id="5588">I have a pile of documents I need to give to the winners of an urban orienteering competition. I need the Minister of Culture and Sports to sign them. Can you help me?</string>
  <string id="5589">I come from a line of well-known film directors. I want to make a sequel to Strain, because the first one was a flop.</string>
  <string id="5590">I'll need 250 million, a personal car and a trip into space as a tourist. It’s a sequel, so everything needs to be twice as epic! Who's in charge here?</string>
  <string id="5591">I have a brilliant idea for a new show! Let's take several people, divide them into two teams and send them off to war!</string>
  <string id="5592">Every week, we'd give them cool missions - like infiltrating enemy lines and finding top-secret intel, or killing twenty enemies in four hours.</string>
  <string id="5593">After three months, the team with the most surviving members wins! It's going to be the bomb! Who can make it happen?</string>
  <string id="5594">I'm the conductor of an orchestra. And I need trumpet players.</string>
  <string id="5595">What happened to your old ones?</string>
  <string id="5596">One of them went to war. Another drinks every day as a result. The third simply vanished. If you don't get me trumpeters, the concert for the anniversary of the Great Leader's rise to power is doomed!</string>
  <string id="5597">I'd also settle for runners and swimmers, as long as they have decent lungs.</string>
  <string id="5598">Hi there! Our shooting team, the Leader's Falcons, wants to apply to take part in the Ministry of Order’s national championships!</string>
  <string id="5599">Have you competed before?</string>
  <string id="5600">No, but I guarantee we’ll massacre the competition!</string>
  <string id="5601">I'm the manager of a band called The Mock Leaders. You've probably heard us on the radio. Please grant us a permit to put on three shows in Helmer.</string>
  <string id="5602">Hi. I represent the seamstresses' trade union. We were promised ten tickets to a Mock Leaders concert, but only got five. I’d like to know what happened to the rest.</string>
  <string id="5603">Hi! Please give me a permit to host a party at our House of Culture to mark the anniversary of the beginning of the war.</string>
  <string id="5604">You're going to celebrate the beginning of the war?!</string>
  <string id="5605">Where would we be now if it wasn’t for the war? We'd be rotting like the South Boreans.</string>
  <string id="5606">Okay, here's the deal. ‘Cause of the war, the army’s taken all our racehorses to the Front.</string>
  <string id="5607">The annual races are in a week, and the Deputy Leader's gonna be there. We don’t have anything to for him to watch.</string>
  <string id="5608">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="5609">I'd like to know if I can replace the horses with cyclists.</string>
  <string id="5610">Hi, I'm a theatrical director. Recently, some people in uniforms showed up and demanded that I remove our production of “Pity” from the repertoire as, supposedly, “pity is vulgar”!</string>
  <string id="5611">I need an official notice stating that my play has already passed the vulgarity screening process. Then I'll be able to fight them off once and for all!</string>
  <string id="5612">Please add me to the list of candidates eligible to receive science grants. I've invented a new type of tank that can be used for farming during peacetime.</string>
  <string id="5613">I call it The Tanktor.</string>
  <string id="5614">My father-in-law came up with a device that distills alcohol from cattle manure. I want to patent it before he does. Can you help me?</string>
  <string id="5615">Over the last year or so, I've noticed a not-insignificant increase in the temperature of our environment. Where can I submit an application to obtain a grant for my research into global warming?</string>
  <string id="5616">Name and address?</string>
  <string id="5617">Denis Guggenheim, 12 Rebellion St., by the Gray Geothermal Springs. That's my new address, I moved there a year or so ago.</string>
  <string id="5618">Recently, a new subspecies of snail was discovered in the south of our great country. Unfortunately, since the locals don't care about whether its a new subspecies or an old one, they keep exterminating it as a pest.</string>
  <string id="5619">We need to set up a nature reserve in order to save the only dragonlike pygmy snails in our country. Two square meters should suffice.</string>
  <string id="5620">Where can I get funding for this grand snail-saving project?</string>
  <string id="5621">Soon, our world will be plunged into darkness. The people need to know, so that they don't panic.</string>
  <string id="5622">What's this about?</string>
  <string id="5623">We've already made all the necessary preparations to minimize casualties. All you need to do is...</string>
  <string id="5624">If you're talking about the apocalypse or an alien invasion, don't worry. We're prepared for those...</string>
  <string id="5625">No, no, you misunderstand me. I work at the university. There's a solar eclipse coming up, and I have to warn everyone - so that they don't go blind looking at it unprotected.</string>
  <string id="5626">A notice in the newspaper and a reminder on the TV news should be enough.</string>
  <string id="5627">Hi! I've invented a way to turn coal, machine oil and flavor supplements into sausage. What forms do I need to fill out for the patent?</string>
  <string id="5628">Sir! My Commander has sent me to get a diagram of some useless piece of trash or something.</string>
  <string id="5629">My Commander has sent me to retrieve a diagram of some piece of crap that burned up in our radio station.</string>
  <string id="5630">He also said your Ministry of Science and Technology is full of wimps and losers, because real men don't waste their time on that shit!</string>
  <string id="5631">Hi! I'm writing a school paper on junk science, and want a permit to get a book called “Space Travel: Dream or Treachery?” from the special archives.</string>
  <string id="5491">I want thirty flags to decorate my street, and 10,000 to spend on patriotic decorations for the benefit of the population!</string>
  <string id="5100">I want to be reassigned. I graduated from culinary college and should be working as a cook, not a welder.</string>
  <string id="5101">The commission said that if I can blowtorch a meringue, then I can blowtorch metal. I disagree!</string>
  <string id="5635">-&gt;$5634</string>
  <string id="5636">I want to press charges! Some policemen beat up my husband on the street! They thought he was a criminal! Now he can't work anymore!</string>
  <string id="5637">How am I supposed to take care of the kids now? I demand that those policemen be punished!</string>
  <string id="5638">Are you sure it was a mistake?</string>
  <string id="5639">Hell yes I am! Beat the guilty, not the innocent!</string>
  <string id="5640">I'm pretty sure someone's been following me! I don't even feel safe at home! Recently, I came home from work and someone had gone through my all stuff!</string>
  <string id="5641">The burglar was so good, he managed to get in without anyone noticing! Even the building manager didn't see anything! Do something!</string>
  <string id="5642">Hello, I have a complaint about the management of our factory. How come they won't let girls join the volunteer militias?</string>
  <string id="5643">The Leader says: 'Women and girls must take the place of the men who have gone to war’. But why don’t we see that in practice? The state doesn’t have enough faith in us!</string>
  <string id="5644">If we can lay down the law in our own homes, we can do the same on the streets!</string>
  <string id="5645">Hi there! I have a little kitty, Agatha. I let her out yesterday, and someone tied a can to her tail!</string>
  <string id="5646">The poor little thing got scared and ran so fast that she crashed into a shop window and broke it. I only just managed to catch her again, and she's still in shock!</string>
  <string id="5647">Please, catch whoever tied that can to her and punish them as the war criminal they are!</string>
  <string id="5648">Unbelievable! This is despicable!</string>
  <string id="5649">Please calm down. What's wrong?</string>
  <string id="5650">Those immigrants... Those refugees... It's downright unacceptable! They go around harassing women on the streets, catcalling, doing all sorts of perverted things!</string>
  <string id="5651">Can you give an example?</string>
  <string id="5652">Of course I can! Yesterday I was walking down the street when a group of them ran up to me, looked me up and down, and ran away without saying a thing! I demand that you find those brutes!</string>
  <string id="5653">Hello. I spent three years knitting a portrait of our Leader to decorate our entrance hall. And guess what? It was in tatters within a week!</string>
  <string id="5654">I've just been working so hard to remind people that the Leader is always there for us! Find whoever did it and prosecute them!</string>
  <string id="5655">Hi. The management of our maternity hospital won't let nurses go to the Solidarity and Loyalty rallies, just ‘cause it means leaving patients in labor unattended.</string>
  <string id="5656">I think that's treason! They can always pump out more kids - but attending rallies is the solemn duty of every true patriot!</string>
  <string id="5657">My son's school won't let him attend anymore. I demand that you punish them all!</string>
  <string id="5658">Do they have a reason?</string>
  <string id="5659">Reason? Are you kidding me? Well yeah, my little man's already twenty, but that doesn't mean he doesn't deserve an education! He's just a daydreamer, and sometimes he has a hard time figuring things out. And there was also that one time he brought a gun to class, but that was a joke!</string>
  <string id="5660">Tell me, how come you send all manner of whores to the resorts, but honest working women never get to go?</string>
  <string id="5661">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="5662">At our factory, they only give resort vouchers to the pregnant ones. And everybody knows that these days, the only women getting pregnant are the whores who can’t keep their legs together!</string>
  <string id="5663">Pregnancy is a natural process.</string>
  <string id="5664">It's only natural if everyone gets to be pregnant. Even though some of us have spent 30 years at this job routinely getting fuc-... Ah, what does it even matter, just do something or I'll file a complaint against you, too!</string>
  <string id="5665">Me and my kids were allocated an apartment on Prosperity Street, but when we got there, it was already occupied. They won't let us in!</string>
  <string id="5666">I'm a decorated blood donor - my blood flows through the veins of thousands of our soldiers. And what am I supposed to do now, keep my kids under my skirt or something? Sort this out!</string>
  <string id="5667">I’m here to ask the Ministry of Labor to investigate and prosecute the management of Bank No. 12 for incompetence!</string>
  <string id="5668">Yesterday, I was trying to withdraw some cash, and was informed that the management ordered all deposits to be used to buy up war bonds!</string>
  <string id="5669">It's not right! I'm just a cashier, and even I know that now's the time to invest in Mining Department bonds!</string>
  <string id="5670">Hello there! I work as a sealer at the local post office.</string>
  <string id="5671">A what?</string>
  <string id="5672">An envelope sealer. I seal them after the letter's been read by the censor. By licking them, I should say.</string>
  <string id="5673">And some clowns have been adding chili pepper extract to the envelope glue! Now my tongue is swollen - I can't work like this! Find them and give them a taste of their own peppers!</string>
  <string id="5674">Hi, can you help me?</string>
  <string id="5675">Sure, that's why I'm here. If you have a request, a complaint, or would like to inform us of something, I'll redirect your query to the right person.</string>
  <string id="5676">And what will they do about it?</string>
  <string id="5677">They will review it and take action.</string>
  <string id="5678">And you?</string>
  <string id="5679">I'll report the result to my supervisor.</string>
  <string id="5680">-&gt;$6955</string>
  <string id="5681">He'll transfer it to the claims department.</string>
  <string id="5682">And then?</string>
  <string id="5683">They’ll... Wait a moment. What exactly is your issue?</string>
  <string id="5684">My issue is that I want to file a complaint against all of you parasites! You’re a bunch of useless bureaucrats shuffling paper around, incapable of solving even the most minuscule problem!</string>
  <string id="5685">What problem?</string>
  <string id="5686">Doesn't matter! I'm going to complain about the people who appointed you here!</string>
  <string id="5687">You’re going to answer for this! You’re going to answer for all of this right now!</string>
  <string id="5689">-&gt;$5688</string>
  <string id="5690">Don't you tell me to calm down! I took my son to watch a synchronized swimming competition, and what did we witness there? Half-naked girls swinging their legs around for public entertainment!</string>
  <string id="5691">But isn't that the whole point?</string>
  <string id="5692">Don't you try to justify this pornography! My boy was so enraged and dumbfounded that he got drool all over his beard! I demand that this sport be banned for threatening public morality in these hard times!</string>
  <string id="5693">Hello! I was recently given permission to purchase a radio, but I think it was made by traitors!</string>
  <string id="5694">What led you to this conclusion?</string>
  <string id="5695">If I tune it to 97.7 FM, press the power and backlight switches together and shake it three times, it picks up a foreign frequency!</string>
  <string id="5696">Do you realize that this is subversive activity?! I insist that you find and prosecute the people who allowed this to happen!</string>
  <string id="5697">What if it's just a defect?</string>
  <string id="5698">What does it matter? What if my kids had been there when I discovered this?! Imagine if they'd heard that South Borean jazz! No! This can't be allowed! I demand an investigation!</string>
  <string id="5699">Hello! I work as a caretaker. I've brought you the weekly list of crimes committed by the tenants of House 2-bis, Entrance 3, in the cul-de-sac of Harmonic Development. I've highlighted the ones who should be executed.</string>

  <string id="5701">Patriotism poll?</string>
  <string id="5702">Yes, we wanted to find out whether our citizens were willing to die if the Leader commands it.</string>
  <string id="5703">And how did it go?</string>
  <string id="5704">Very well! Some of the respondents didn’t even need to answer verbally - they just went ahead and did it!</string>
  <string id="5705">He is to the motherland, what rain is to the desert sand!</string>
  <string id="5707">-&gt;$5706</string>
  <string id="5708">Love the Leader as you must, those who don’t shall soon be dust!</string>

  <string id="5710">Don't you worry, don't be stressed, our Dear Leader knows what's best!</string>
  <string id="5711">I'm calling security!</string>
  <string id="5712">Don't! I was told to submit some new slogans for a rally, so I decided to test them out on you. What do you think? Stirring, huh? Here's the full list - twelve pages, all approved and signed.</string>
  <string id="5713">Hi! Here's a list of unmarried women librarians.</string>
  <string id="5714">What for?</string>
  <string id="5715">To be disseminated within male-dominated companies! Every hard-working man needs a smart woman! Haven't you received the latest directive from the Ministry of Social Care? About increasing the birth rate?</string>

  <string id="5730">Hello! My neighbor, Rosa Dirk, is illegally selling perfume that her husband confiscates from smugglers at the border.</string>
  <string id="5731">They call it a “customs seized-property sale”, but where do the proceeds go? Into their pockets, that's where!</string>
  <string id="5732">This is complete fraud - I read about it in a bulletin from the Ministry of Order! Arrest those criminals!</string>
  <string id="5734">-&gt;$5733</string>
  <string id="5736">-&gt;$5735</string>
  <string id="5737">Hi! I saw a “Wanted” ad, and I have information on the whereabouts of one of the criminals!</string>
  <string id="5738">At this very moment, Claud Renue, the Number 4 most-wanted criminal in the country, is lounging on my couch with a newspaper and refusing to buy me a fur coat! Who should I report this to?</string>
  <string id="5740">-&gt;$5739</string>
  <string id="5741">Guess what? My neighbor, Elena Tadeush, didn't change her curtains on The Day of Greatness and ruined the whole design aesthetic of our building. We were all supposed to display the colors of our flag!</string>
  <string id="5742">Hello, I'm here to let you know that the bricklayer Wanda Wonderkampf refuses to take part in patriotic rallies just ‘cause she has three kids to take care of.</string>
  <string id="5743">Taking care of three kids must take up a lot of time...</string>
  <string id="5744">I sent all five of mine off to the orphanage! That's what the state built them for, isn’t it? And attending rallies is our sacred duty!</string>
  <string id="5745">Hello. As a veteran's widow, I'm entitled to housing benefits. But Victor Padrabinek, my building manager, says it doesn’t count because I'm seeing another man!</string>
  <string id="5746">How is that fair? Is there anything you can do?</string>
  <string id="5747">Hey, Miss, I'd like to...</string>
  <string id="5748">I'm a man!</string>
  <string id="5749">Oh, sorry. My eyesight isn’t the best. I'd like to report that Philip Danke, our doctor, is harassing his patients.</string>
  <string id="5750">Did he hit on you?</string>
  <string id="5751">No, but when I went in for my appointment, he told me to take my clothes off and fold them up beside his own. I don't think that's typical for eye doctors.</string>
  <string id="5753">-&gt;$5752</string>
  <string id="5754">Hi! I work at a chemical plant. They give us free milk to make up for all that exposure to hazardous materials. So our supervisor, Tomash Nezygar, decreased our milk allowance and has been selling the rest at the farmers' market!</string>
  <string id="5755">I've got a kid - he needs milk! Punish Nezygar and give us back our milk!</string>
  <string id="5756">Dan Kiusak, the head of the fire department, won't hire me ‘cause I'm a woman! I was a star athlete, I've done a hundred skydives, I served in the army!</string>
  <string id="5757">But you're pregnant!</string>
  <string id="5758">Let those pansies from the music school whine about being pregnant! I demand that Kiusak hire me!</string>
  <string id="5759">Hello! Angela Dadis, who works as a weaver, figured out a way of operating five machines at once. She’s ended up with a bunch of free time and spends it reading at work!</string>
  <string id="5760">-&gt;$6537</string>

  <string id="5767">-&gt;$6106</string>
  <string id="5768">Daniel Blackcliff stole the best years of my life!</string>
  <string id="5769">I'm sorry, but what is the Ministry supposed to do about that?</string>
  <string id="5770">“The Best Years of My Life” is a novel I've been working on for the past five years!</string>
  <string id="5771">He published it under his own name, and I know for a fact that Directive No. 8696 bans plagiarism! I need “The Best Years of My Life” back, I'm begging you!</string>
  <string id="5772">Greetings! I was at the “Die Singing!” festival and I'd like to report that during the performance, the conductor - Isaak Weinstein - started waving his baton around and using it to write obscenities in the air!</string>
  <string id="5773">We can’t tolerate this kind of behavior anymore!</string>
  <string id="5774">Well, hello there! I've been the prima donna at the theatre for the past 40 years. I've played all the great roles. You may know me from...</string>
  <string id="5775">Sorry, but I have a lot to do. Can you cut to the chase?</string>
  <string id="5776">Ah, but of course. Ingmar Barebuttullo, the director of the city military theatre, put on a new play called “Love for War”. He made all the actresses dress up as soldiers, lined them up, and then stood to attention right in front of them!</string>
  <string id="5777">-&gt;$6658</string>
  <string id="5778">Exactly, young man, exactly!</string>
  <string id="5779">That's horrible!</string>
  <string id="5780">Isn’t it just? Those girls are dilettantes when it comes to art! And that sad old fool didn't even give me a uniform! I demand that you restore the status quo - everyone must know who the real prima donna is!</string>
  <string id="5781">Hello. The women's gymnastics coach, Ann Bolthaway, hung up a portrait of the South Borean world champion in the gym to encourage the girls to follow her example.</string>
  <string id="5782">Positive role models are a good thing, aren't they?</string>
  <string id="5783">I disagree completely! The girls are warming up, stretching out, and bending over in front of that portrait all day long! Is that what we fought for? For our youth to bow down to the South Boreans?!</string>
  <string id="5784">Bolthaway must be isolated from society - she is corrupting our children!</string>
  <string id="5785">Hi, I work at the Institute of Radiology.</string>
  <string id="5786">I'd like to inform you that professor Magda Kovalevskaya spends all day working with radioactive materials, then just goes home without anybody stopping her!</string>
  <string id="5788">-&gt;$5787</string>
  <string id="5789">She’s stealing the radiation she's exposed to at work! I measured it myself - she's lit up like a chunk of uranium!</string>
  <string id="5790">That is not good...</string>
  <string id="5791">Exactly! We can't let her out of the lab! Every atom counts! Do something at once!</string>
  <string id="5792">Hi! My neighbor, Alexander Timofeev, has built a time machine in his apartment.</string>
  <string id="5793">Time machines aren't real.</string>
  <string id="5794">Oh yeah? Next you'll tell me that the pterodactyl in my kitchen isn't real, either. It ate all my sausages! I demand that you put an end to this madness at once!</string>
  <string id="5795">I was looking at yesterday's Most Wanted pictures in the newspaper, and one of them looked familiar.</string>
  <string id="5796">He's the spitting image of my husband! I don't believe it, of course, but I'd like to double check whether Public Enemy No. 3 has a mole on his left buttock.</string>
  <string id="5798">-&gt;$5797</string>
  <string id="5799">Excuse me, I'm trying to find out where Simon Popesku was taken to. He was arrested yesterday at the factory gates - they say he was handing out pamphlets to the workers, but I call bullshit!</string>
  <string id="5800">Simon would never do that - he has three kids to take care of! Please help!</string>
  <string id="5801">Hello, I have an explanatory statement regarding the length of my daughter's skirt. She was detained for thirty days for allegedly breaching the decree on mini-skirts, but the girl's simply grown up too fast!</string>
  <string id="5802">I can't keep up with her growth spurt! Where should I bring my statement?</string>
  <string id="5803">Hello. My fiancé and I were attacked while we were out taking a walk.</string>
  <string id="5804">My sweetheart protected me, but the police took him in because one of the attackers died. I'd like to know what will happen to him now.</string>
  <string id="5805">Hey there! Can I get one of those Most Wanted posters from the Ministry of Order?</string>
  <string id="5806">What for?</string>
  <string id="5807">The guys on them... They're assertive, powerful, dangerous, they have eyes like a tiger's... Just my type! I wanna hang the poster over my bed.</string>
  <string id="5808">Hello! I've been corresponding with an inmate, but he’s stopped replying since he got transferred. Can I find out where he was moved to?</string>
  <string id="5809">Tell me, is the Leader married?</string>
  <string id="5810">I don't know.</string>
  <string id="5811">Well, he's only human, right? So naturally he'll need someone by his side to care for him and give him advice. He works so hard!</string>
  <string id="5812">I'd like to apply for that position. I understand that being the Leader's wife will be hard, even dangerous, but I'll do anything for the Motherland and for our continued Victory! Can this be arranged?</string>
  <string id="5813">Hello! The girls from our dorm have answered the Ministry of Patriotism's call and donated a hundred pairs of stockings to be upcycled into parachute cords.</string>
  <string id="5814">We'd rather go commando than leave the Motherland without parachutes! Where should I leave our donation?</string>
  <string id="5815">Hi! All of us seamstresses at the factory would like to present the Leader with a new dress uniform. But unfortunately, we don't know his measurements. Where can I find them out?</string>
  <string id="5816">Hello! I heard I can sign up to obtain a special device that helps single ladies relieve their feelings of loneliness. Is that true? Do I need to fill out any forms?</string>
  <string id="5817">Are you single?</string>
  <string id="5818">Are you? How about dinner? Who knows, maybe I won’t need that device after all...</string>
  <string id="5819">Sorry, but I'm on duty.</string>
  <string id="5820">Hello! I have with me an analytical report on how to increase theatre attendance.</string>
  <string id="5821">We calculated that we can increase attendance by 107% if we open up performances to kindergartners, seniors from assisted living facilities, and patients from psychiatric wards.</string>
  <string id="5822">The Ministry of Culture and Sports has already approved it. Now we need just the Ministry of Social Care to OK everything and hand over the psychos.</string>
  <string id="5823">Hi! I’ve brought veterinary passports for all my kitties. Can I register cat therapy as a medical treatment now?</string>
  <string id="5824">Medical treatment?</string>
  <string id="5825">Yes, for lonely people. Administer one cat per year of solitude, and the depression is gone! Where do I hand over the documents?</string>
  <string id="5826">Hi! I have underwear ration cards, but our local store doesn't carry my size. Can I trade them for butter rations? Or vegetable oil? Either will do the trick!</string>
  <string id="5827">I'm the principal of Kindergarten No. 345. Somehow, we were sent sandals instead of snow boots for the kids. Must've been a clerical error.</string>
  <string id="5828">I've arranged a swap with some of my colleagues in the South, but we need permission from the Ministry. What do I need to do?</string>
  <string id="5829">Hello! I'd like to submit a request to the Ministry of Labor to obtain someone’s personal information. He was ordered to do correctional labor for the “Yet Another Twenty Years of the Leader” anniversary celebrations.</string>
  <string id="5830">If you could only see how he works his jackhammer! It's divine!</string>
  <string id="5831">Sorry, but we're not a dating service.</string>
  <string id="5832">But he left his keys on my nightstand! Is there any way at all I could get his address?</string>
  <string id="5833">Hi. D'you have any jobs where I wouldn’t need to do any work?</string>
  <string id="5834">I don't provide employment assistance. What do you want?</string>
  <string id="5835">I want nothing, but Mom says it's hard for her to carry on pulling double shifts as a janitor. As if it's that hard to do an extra shift! What does she expect me to do, ruin my nails? So, do you have any jobs with zero workload?</string>
  <string id="5836">So here I am, a simple blue-collar worker, and just don't understand what the fu-...</string>
  <string id="5837">Whoa whoa whoa! Language, ma'am!</string>
  <string id="5838">I'm saying I don't understand what the fusty management at the boiler station is thinking! I'm pulling three shifts down there by myself, and they want me to pick up another one!</string>
  <string id="5839">Hi there! We're our factory’s women's arm-wrestling team. We'd like to enter the “Wreck 'em for the Leader” tournament. Where do we sign up?</string>
  <string id="5840">Hello, I need the circus events programme. I want to take our senior-year students there to show them what true beauty is.</string>
  <string id="5841">At the circus?</string>
  <string id="5842">Yes. Our school offers the full range of developmental activities - military training, arts and crafts and, of course, the circus!</string>
  <string id="5843">Hi! My husband says that scientists have declared that a bottle of red wine a day lowers the risk of heart attacks by 50%.</string>
  <string id="5844">And?</string>
  <string id="5845">And I'd like an official retraction of this claim. I won't last another six months living with that health nut!</string>
  <string id="5846">I recently bought some new mascara. It says on the package that it's specially formulated from used machine oil and gunpowder residue.</string>
  <string id="5847">I'd like to find out how to remove it.</string>
  <string id="5848">Hi there! I assume you’re the one I’ve been waiting for. My name is George Hemnitz.</string>
  <string id="5849">Nice to meet you. Evan.</string>
  <string id="5850">You must be quite a big deal, Evan.</string>
  <string id="5851">-&gt;$10592</string>
  <string id="5852">I've been with the Ministry for 8 years, 4 months, and 12 days. In that time, I’ve processed 18,342 applications, had 1,629 cups of coffee, and witnessed 284 incidents of civil disorder.</string>
  <string id="5853">Now ask me how many times I’ve been sent to welcome a new employee on his first day.</string>
  <string id="5854">How many?</string>
  <string id="5855">Zero, Evan. Zilch! Not once in all those 3,052 days! So there has to be something special about you, right?</string>
  <string id="5856">You're right, I'm a big shot at the Ministry</string>
  <string id="5857">My last name is Redgrave. Heard of it?</string>
  <string id="5858">I have no idea what you’re talking about</string>
  <string id="5859">Perhaps you’ve gotten me mixed up with someone else. I'm just here to be a clerk. My name's Evan Redgrave.</string>
  <string id="5860">Redgrave? As in, “Redgrave” Redgrave?! Oh God! Your father...</string>
  <string id="5861">My deepest condolences. I can't imagine what you must be going through right now. And to think I saw him just 58 hours and 23 minutes before he... Before his death....</string>
  <string id="5862">We weren't that close. To be honest, we hadn't talked in a decade. Up until yesterday, I didn't even know he worked here.</string>
  <string id="5863">Your father didn't just work here - he was one of the most respected people in the Ministry. One of the few people to make it to the very top.</string>
  <string id="5864">And the most amazing thing is, he never looked down on his subordinates. He was an open and honest man.</string>
  <string id="5865">What happened? Have the police found anything out?</string>
  <string id="5918">People like us are never told much, so I only know one or two things for sure. The rest is all just hearsay and fantasies dreamed up by employees with nothing better to do.</string>
  <string id="5867">What are the facts?</string>
  <string id="5868">47 hours and 23 minutes ago your father fell from a window on the top floor of the Ministry. He fell 37 floors, hit the pavement and died instantly.</string>
  <string id="5869">Law enforcement are working tirelessly to find out how and why this happened. Or at least, that’s what they say they’re doing.</string>
  <string id="5870">That's not much to go on...</string>
  <string id="5871">I might have some important information to give you in connection with your father's death.</string>
  <string id="5872">But it’d be better to discuss it somewhere quiet, and after I’ve given you your instructions and shown you to your desk.</string>
  <string id="5873">We’re here for a reason, after all! Ready for your first day at the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="5874">Let's get to it.</string>
  <string id="5875">The Ministry is considered, quite rightfully, to be one of the most beautiful and well-equipped buildings in the country. Have a look for yourself: it’s 226 meters tall, contains 12,742 offices spread out over its 37 floors, and welcomes over 325,000 visitors a day!</string>
  <string id="5876">Sometimes I catch myself thinking about all those thousands of people, and trying to calculate just how many more consumer goods they could be producing if they didn’t have to spend all their time waiting in lines.</string>
  <string id="5877">But even I can’t handle those kinds of numbers, and I always give up.</string>
  <string id="5878">Check out the statue of the Wise Leader in the square. It took 5,500 tons of concrete and 2,400 tons of metal to build it.</string>
  <string id="5879">That statue weighs 8,000 tons! We could have built eight kindergartens and a hospital with all those materials, but the Ministry knows what the people really need.</string>
  <string id="5880">Impressive, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="5881">This cold, indifferent pavement is where your father met his end.</string>
  <string id="5882">Now all the gossips love to hang around here. You can listen in on them, but you're not likely to hear anything particularly useful or nice.</string>
  <string id="5883">You should get used to it, though. That’s just how it is around here - no matter what position you're in, you've got to listen carefully, take note of everything and report it to the higher-ups.</string>
  <string id="5884">The safety and security of the Ministry are another source of pride for us. The security guards can be some of your best friends here - especially if you’re able to come to some kind of arrangement with them...</string>
  <string id="5885">Our guards have thwarted 985 terrorist acts this year alone. That's an average of almost four attempts a day!</string>
  <string id="5886">So make sure you’ve always got some cash on you, just in case, and don’t do anything to spoil their numbers. Do you follow me?</string>
  <string id="5887">Looks like someone’s up to no good! We use cutting-edge technologies to protect the people of our great state! These checkpoints are connected to the main Ministry database by the latest fibre optic technology. The connection speed is over 10 gigabits a second!</string>
  <string id="5888">These checkpoints screen for prohibited items and identify them immediately. We spent over 180,000,000 on the development of this technology.</string>
  <string id="5889">That said, there’s always a way to get around the checkpoints - if you butter up the guards enough.</string>
  <string id="5890">As I said before, there are 37 floors, and twice that many underground. At least, according to official data.</string>
  <string id="5891">The higher the floor, the better the job. If you work hard, you might make it to the top. But keep in mind that a lot of people want to get promoted, so competition here is fierce and merciless.</string>
  <string id="5919">People here would do anything for a promotion. Some scheme against their coworkers, some suck up to the bosses.</string>
  <string id="5893">Some nutjobs even try to further their careers by working hard. Those people aren’t right in the head. The way all of this is set up, it’s next to impossible to get anywhere by working hard.</string>
  <string id="5894">Though I think someone with your last name won’t have much difficulty moving up the ladder. One day, you'll get a promotion and step into that elevator. Best of all, everyone else on this floor will be jealous!</string>
  <string id="5895">We should always remember why we are here, and what it took to get us here.</string>
  <string id="5896">Every now and then it’s worth showing the proper respect to the one who sacrificed everything for his people. Remember: the Wise Leader is ever vigilant!</string>
  <string id="5897">Things like happiness and sadness come and go. But the Leader is ever present.</string>
  <string id="5898">This is where we hold general meetings. They’re usually pretty mundane - some people get rewarded for their work, others get reprimanded for theirs. Sometimes, we also publicly condemn the actions of our neighbor states.</string>
  <string id="5920">Some smartass suggested that we call the meetings “Five Minutes of Hatred”. He got reprimanded on the spot and hasn’t made any further suggestions since. Or more accurately, he hasn’t been able to.</string>
  <string id="5900">We also sing patriotic songs here sometimes. I’ve sung the national anthem 426 times this month!</string>
  <string id="5901">The first floor of the Ministry has an area of 440,000 square meters. Incredible, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="5902">440,000 square meters of bureaucratic heaven!</string>
  <string id="5903">See those lines? Every single person standing there has come here with a problem. Whether it's a real issue or not isn't up to us to decide. Our job is to send people to the right department.</string>
  <string id="5904">But it's important not to get too much done... We don't want people thinking that the Ministry doesn't have enough to do.</string>
  <string id="5905">This one is as clumsy as they come - he’s always dropping something. I can never remember his name.</string>
  <string id="5906">You can help him if you want. But helping others isn’t really “the done thing” around here.</string>
  <string id="5907">On one hand, of course, people might be grateful for your help. On the other... You never really know what other people are up to.</string>
  <string id="5908">Most of the people here wouldn’t pass up the chance to trip you up or stab you in the back.</string>
  <string id="5909">And I mean that quite literally. But what you do is up to you.</string>
  <string id="5910">A commendable choice. Keep in mind you can't help everyone, no matter how hard you try. And trust me, I’ve tried.</string>
  <string id="5911">Sometimes the best choice is not to get involved.</string>
  <string id="5921">If you sit on the riverbank long enough, the current might sweep away your enemies for you.</string>
  <string id="5913">What I’m saying is that it’s perfectly acceptable to take a neutral position. Or an “indifferent” one, as some might call it. There are a lot of people here who don’t care one way or another.</string>
  <string id="5914">Wow! I see you’re not one to tolerate weakness. Well, walking all over people and destroying the competition is an approach that works well in here.</string>
  <string id="5915">Many have risen through the ranks that way. And anyway, who am I to judge a Redgrave?</string>
  <string id="5916">And here's the general hall. You'll be spending a lot of time here working or talking to coworkers.</string>
  <string id="5917">That's your desk. Take a look around. I'll give you your first assignment when you're ready.</string>
  <string id="7566">Enough chit-chat, let’s just get to the Ministry!</string>
  <string id="7567">Understood. I promise I won’t talk too talk much on the way there.</string>
  <string id="7568">Go on, Hemnitz. What did you want to say?</string>
  <string id="7569">Remember how you promised “not to talk too much” on the way, Hemnitz? I shudder to think what “too much” means to you.</string>
  <string id="5922">Yes, of course, let’s all kick Morris when he’s down. Is there anyone who still hasn't kicked Morris today yet?</string>
  <string id="5923">I've already had coffee poured over my head and a pin put on my seat...</string>
  <string id="5924">Isn't it hilarious to push clumsy old Morris the doormat around? And laugh at him while he’s crawling on the floor collecting his papers...</string>
  <string id="5925">-&gt;$6933</string>
  <string id="5926">Let me help you.</string>
  <string id="5927">Ha ha. Very funny, sir, very funny...</string>
  <string id="5928">I'm being serious. I'd be happy to help you pick everything up.</string>
  <string id="5929">Really? Are you from another Ministry? Or are you just new?</string>
  <string id="5930">Today's my first day.</string>
  <string id="5931">That explains it! I wonder if you'll stay that way... Or if you’ll become just like the others.</string>
  <string id="5932">Anyway, thank you very much, sir.</string>
  <string id="5933">Clumsy Morris might not be the most useful person to have as a friend... And he might not be the most pleasant person to be around... But...</string>
  <string id="5934">... You can be sure that I'll return your kindness as best I can!</string>
  <string id="5935">Don't mention it!</string>
  <string id="5936">Spit in his face</string>
  <string id="5937">Out of my way, freak!</string>
  <string id="5938">What a very creative young man! Such ingenuity!</string>
  <string id="5939">No one has spat in clumsy Morris's face before! I'll remember that. Can you tell me your name?</string>
  <string id="5940">Evan Redgrave. Write it down so you don't forget, you scatterbrained klutz.</string>
  <string id="5941">Redgrave? That explains a lot...</string>
  <string id="5942">What are you still wittering on about? Do you need some sense beaten into you?</string>
  <string id="5943">I said thank you for stopping by and taking the time to talk...</string>
  <string id="5944">-&gt;$10274</string>
  <string id="5945">I'm in hurry.</string>
  <string id="5946">Everyone's in a hurry.</string>
  <string id="5947">They rush around, all the while losing themselves and their loved ones.</string>
  <string id="5948">Clumsy Morris is the only one not in a hurry. Why hurry towards the next humiliation?</string>
  <string id="5949">Wait!</string>
  <string id="5950">It's me, clumsy Morris. Do you remember me? You helped me pick up my papers when everyone else ignored me.</string>
  <string id="5951">I promised I’d thank you. Here you are! It's not much, but it's the best I can do.</string>
  <string id="5952">What is this, Morris? You didn't have to...</string>
  <string id="5953">But I did! </string>
  <string id="5954">There's no better teacher than a book. They help you learn new skills.</string>
  <string id="5962">Thank you, Morris! I really appreciate it.</string>
  <string id="5963">No, thank you. I've been working here for fifteen years, and you're the first person who actually stopped to help.</string>
  <string id="5964">It's me, clumsy Morris! Do you remember me, Redgrave? You did me the kindness of spitting in my face.</string>
  <string id="5965">Was that meant to be funny? What do you want, you little shining wit?</string>
  <string id="5966">I'm just a little man delivering papers around the office. The boss’s secretary asked me to take something to Accounting.</string>
  <string id="5967">The timesheet for your first day of work was in there.</string>
  <string id="5968">What do you mean “was”?</string>
  <string id="5969">Ah, you're quite smart for a Redgrave. It... How can I put it... Got a little bit lost. Ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="5970">So what now?</string>
  <string id="5971">So now you'll be fined, you heartless bastard! Good luck!</string>
  <string id="7563">I don't have time to talk about this.</string>
  <string id="8564">You cannot change you choice</string>
  <string id="15321">Codes required:</string>
  <string id="5973">Have you had a look around? Then I’ll take you to your workplace and show you the ropes.</string>
  <string id="5974">Do you already know what your job involves?</string>
  <string id="5975">Listen to briefing</string>
  <string id="5976">Tell me about my job.</string>
  <string id="5977">So, right now we're in the general hall. The people working in these booths send visitors to ministries and offices.</string>
  <string id="5978">This place is the front line of our bureaucratic defense. Only the chosen few are allowed through.</string>
  <string id="5979">Are you talking about us?</string>
  <string id="5980">Do you feel like you've been chosen? Everyone always thinks that they’re special, different. But in fact, we're all the same...</string>
  <string id="5981">Two square meters of skin, two hundred and six bones, five liters of blood - well, as long as you eat right and you’re not a decorated blood donor, that is.</string>
  <string id="5982">And, sooner or later, we all die. Except for the Wise Leader, of course. But before we get to die, we have to work hard.</string>
  <string id="5983">You'll be dealing with visitors. Listen to their appeals, figure out which forms they need, decide which ministry they have to see and then send them to an available office. You need to press the right buttons in your terminal, print out the forms and give them to the visitors.</string>
  <string id="5984">Ask about the forms</string>
  <string id="5985">What kind of forms are there?</string>
  <string id="5986">We have four types of forms: requests, complaints, denunciations and information. Choose the most suitable type based on the appeal. You can find some useful information about the different types of forms in your terminal if you’re having a hard time choosing the right one.</string>
  <string id="5987">Ask about the ministries</string>
  <string id="5988">How many ministries are there?</string>
  <string id="5989">In actual fact, a great many ministries are established and abolished every single day, and we never have enough time to keep the register up to date. Fortunately for you, the Big Six never change: the Ministries of Order, Patriotism, Social Care, Labor, Culture and Sports, and Science and Technology.</string>
  <string id="5990">So just listen to the visitors carefully and decide which of these six ministries to send them to.</string>
  <string id="5991">Ask about offices</string>
  <string id="5992">You mentioned offices?</string>
  <string id="5993">Each ministry has several offices here. You’ll see their weekly timetable in the terminal.</string>
  <string id="5994">If there are no available offices, reject the appeal.</string>
  <string id="5995">Finish briefing</string>
  <string id="5996">Everything’s clear so far. In theory, anyway...</string>
  <string id="5997">Now let's see how much theory differs from practice.</string>
  <string id="5998">Don't listen to briefing</string>
  <string id="5999">I think it's pretty straightforward.</string>
  <string id="6000">Good!</string>
  <string id="6001">So, let's start with the basics: the forms. Your task for today is to process five visitors. You'll earn Authority for meeting your quota.</string>
  <string id="6002">Authority? I'd rather have money.</string>
  <string id="6003">Evan, in our Ministry, Authority is much more valuable than money! Anyone can steal or find money, but Authority has to be earned.</string>
  <string id="6004">Without it, you can forget about promotions, rewards and your whole career. If you don't have enough influence in the Ministry, your colleagues won't even talk to you.</string>
  <string id="6005">What a lovely day.</string>
  <string id="6006">Report back</string>
  <string id="6007">I've fulfilled the quota. What's next?</string>
  <string id="6008">Great, keep it up! Actually, I have nothing more to tell you about your job - you're on your own now. Get settled in, meet your coworkers, and earn Authority.</string>
  <string id="6009">If you roll up your sleeves and work hard eight hours a day, sooner or later you’ll be promoted to manager and get to work twelve hours a day! Isn't that an exciting thought?</string>
  <string id="6010">I'll keep that in mind. Thank you, George.</string>
  <string id="6011">I'll make a note in the journal that you’ve had your briefing. All the necessary documents are in that over there. Take them to Magda Rakovich, the boss’s secretary.</string>
  <string id="6012">I'll wait for you by the statue. We still have more to talk about.</string>
  <string id="6013">Evan, try not to make mistakes on the job. Listen carefully to the visitors and direct them to available offices.</string>
  <string id="6014">The work you do here is of the utmost importance to our country! I have nothing else to tell you about your job - you're on your own now. Get settled in, meet your colleagues, earn Authority.</string>
  <string id="6015">If you roll up your sleeves and work hard eight hours a day, sooner or later you’ll be promoted to manager and get to work twelve hours a day! Isn't that an exciting thought?</string>
  <string id="6016">Ask about what to do</string>
  <string id="6017">How do I process the forms?</string>
  <string id="6018">Take your seat, get a set of forms, and start talking to visitors and filling in information. And try not to mess up too badly!</string>
  <string id="6019">Ask about Authority</string>
  <string id="6020">How can I earn Authority?</string>
  <string id="6022">You earn it by meeting your quota for processed appeals. Don't let me down!</string>
  <string id="6023">Ask about visitors</string>
  <string id="6024">Who are all these people?</string>
  <string id="6025">The visitors? They're... just people! Not people like you and me, of course - we work for the Ministry. These are ordinary people with ordinary problems.</string>
  <string id="6026">When they can't solve these problems themselves, they come to us. We are their last hope, Evan. Remember, if we don't help them, no one else will!</string>
  <string id="6027">They might cry, swear, laugh and even threaten you. They can be unpleasant, rude, mean and cruel.</string>
  <string id="6028">But always remember that they came here to get help. And your job is...</string>
  <string id="6029">To help them. I understand.</string>
  <string id="6030">No! Your job is to process their requests correctly. Whether or not that helps them has nothing to do with us.</string>
  <string id="6031">You won't go helping people at your own expense now, will you? I'm the only one here who actually cares about strangers and I stick out like a sore thumb because of it.</string>
  <string id="6032">-&gt;$6365</string>
  <string id="6033">-&gt;$11931</string>
  <string id="6034">-&gt;$6419</string>
  <string id="6035">Yes, I was familiar with Redgrave Senior. Isn't it strange? That such a respected man at the very top of the Ministry would deign to talk grunts like me. Why did the two of you not keep in touch?</string>
  <string id="6036">Reply honestly</string>
  <string id="6037">After my mother died years ago, he withdrew, buried himself in his work, and sent me to the most remote university in the country.</string>
  <string id="6038">That must have been tough.</string>
  <string id="6039">The most hurtful thing was that he didn't even try to find out her cause of death.</string>
  <string id="6040">Like she meant nothing to him.</string>
  <string id="6041">I'm sorry to hear that, Evan. But maybe you’re just not aware of the whole story.</string>
  <string id="6042">Well he's dead now, so there's no way to find out.</string>
  <string id="6043">-&gt;$6438</string>
  <string id="6044">I think fathers and sons will always inevitably come into conflict with each other. Don’t you?</string>
  <string id="6045">I can't say for sure. I didn't know my father.</string>
  <string id="6046">Reply rudely</string>
  <string id="6047">Do you know how many citizens live in this city right now?</string>
  <string id="6048">According to the latest census, 3,678,000 - excluding suburban areas and unregistered citizens. Why?</string>
  <string id="6049">How come that out of such a huge number of people, I end up stuck talking to the one damn person who wants to ask that question?</string>
  <string id="6050">Sorry, I didn't mean pry.</string>
  <string id="6051">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="6052">Ask about his work</string>
  <string id="6053">How long have you been working here?</string>
  <string id="6054">I spent exactly three years and twelve days processing visitors on this very spot.</string>
  <string id="6055">Then I got promoted to floor inspector for my ability recite all 769 rules and 242 amendments by heart. Not too shabby, eh?</string>
  <string id="6056">It was a useless achievement, but still! I just have to work another two years, five months and eight days and then I'll be moved up to Floor 17, the Control and Supervision department.</string>
  <string id="6057">How do you like it here?</string>
  <string id="6058">It's nice! I help our employees solve their problems and I take care of people. Even though they never thank me, I know I'm doing a good job!</string>
  <string id="6059">-&gt;$6666</string>
  <string id="6060">Who will I be working with?</string>
  <string id="6061">The people here are nice - when they need something from you. Do them a couple of favors, smile, and chat when you have a break.</string>
  <string id="6062">I do not recommend trusting them or sharing any secrets you might have. I've seen how many denunciations there are in the Ministry of Internal Control.</string>
  <string id="6063">I love statistics and numbers, and even I couldn't figure out how many of them there were. There were mountains and mountains of forms awaiting processing.</string>
  <string id="6064">So I doubt your secrets would stay secret for any longer than the time it takes to write up a report.</string>
  <string id="6065">-&gt;$11669</string>
  <string id="6066">Tell me about Magda Rakovich.</string>
  <string id="6067">She’s Ferguson's secretary.</string>
  <string id="6068">They say she used to be drop-dead gorgeous. But something happened to her... Now everyone just calls her “The Gorgon”.</string>
  <string id="6069">Pay no mind if she yells at you. She always does that. Money is the only thing that can get through that thick hide of hers.</string>
  <string id="6070">-&gt;$6376</string>
  <string id="6071">The atmosphere here is pretty intense. If you don’t mind my asking, do you have a family?</string>
  <string id="6072">Yes I do! I have a wife, two children, a dog, and a Class D apartment like everyone else. What about you?</string>
  <string id="6073">My wife and daughter. They're moving here to join me a little later.</string>
  <string id="6074">-&gt;$7657</string>
  <string id="6075">Does your wife mind you working so much?</string>
  <string id="6076">I'm doing important work, and Rose knows that. All loyal citizens owe a debt to society, and that trumps everything else! Sometimes she puzzles at how my particular debt seems to have gotten so large, but that's just a little joke of hers.</string>
  <string id="6077">-&gt;$6174</string>
  <string id="6078">Class D?</string>
  <string id="6079">Almost all officials who've served more than five years are awarded a place in line for Class D housing.</string>
  <string id="6080">We spent years and years on the waiting list before we got our apartment. It's a dream come true! We have our own bathroom!</string>
  <string id="6081">I heard that you were allocated a Class D apartment right away. You're incredibly lucky. I suppose having the surname Redgrave has its advantages.</string>
  <string id="6082">Ask about his children</string>
  <string id="6083">How many children do you have?</string>
  <string id="6084">Two. Aster is my pride and joy. She already knows all of last year's directives by heart - at the age of five!</string>
  <string id="6085">Adam is two years younger...</string>
  <string id="6086">Aren't you proud of your son, too?</string>
  <string id="6087">The thing is, that... he is... special...</string>
  <string id="6089">-&gt;$6088</string>
  <string id="6090">Aspergillus niger.</string>
  <string id="6091">What's that?</string>
  <string id="6092">It's a fairly common black mold. Class J buildings are full of it, and it's very hard to get rid of. And the consequences of spending too much time around it are... Well...</string>
  <string id="6093">Meningitis is not the best thing for a three-year-old.</string>
  <string id="6094">-&gt;$14279</string>
  <string id="6095">Not really. We've gotten used to it. Anyway, he's our son and we love him. Sometimes he even recognizes who we are.</string>
  <string id="6096">-&gt;$13914</string>
  <string id="6097">I heard it isn’t easy to get a dog these days.</string>
  <string id="6098">It's not too difficult - it just takes a while. You have to submit all seven types of application, pass a medical examination, undergo psychological and narcotics screenings, provide excerpts from your bank statements and the tenants’ register...</string>
  <string id="6099">...As well as your employment certificate and copies of all your papers: from your passport to the deed of ownership for your fridge.</string>
  <string id="6100">And permission from the neighbors. Nothing that any seasoned bureaucrat can’t handle.</string>
  <string id="6101">And that dog makes the kids so happy!</string>
  <string id="6102">You and your family should come over for dinner some time. My wife would be happy to have you over, and I'm sure our children would get on well!</string>
  <string id="6103">What did you want to talk about?</string>
  <string id="6105">It's about your father, Evan. What happened to him was just awful. There’s something I have to tell you.</string>
  <string id="6107">-&gt;$6106</string>
  <string id="6108">At most, twenty people in the whole country know what I’m about to tell you. I'm taking a huge risk by divulging these details to you. So I have to ask you: don’t say a word to anyone! Okay?</string>
  <string id="6109">Let's hear it.</string>
  <string id="6110">As you know, I was appointed to the position of floor inspector several years ago. But at the same time, I was enlisted to work in Department 6.</string>
  <string id="6111">Department 6? That's a myth! No sane person actually believes in it.</string>
  <string id="6112">The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. Department 6 is considered to be a myth because that's how the person in charge wanted it. More precisely, that's how your father wanted it.</string>
  <string id="6113">My father was the head of Department 6?! What went on there?</string>
  <string id="6114">Work on “Heimdall”, a secret project helmed by your father, began at that time. That's how we met.</string>
  <string id="6115">I’ve always been good with numbers, so I was invited on board to... assess statistical errors and their potential consequences...</string>
  <string id="6116">He didn't talk much about himself, but mentioned having a son a few times.</string>
  <string id="6117">And his eyes lit up every time he did! He was proud of you, believe me.</string>
  <string id="6118">What else did my father say about me?</string>
  <string id="6119">We didn't keep in contact for the last ten years...</string>
  <string id="6120">He did mention that he was no longer in touch with you, but he always hoped that someday you'd come and join him.</string>
  <string id="6121">Why do you think so?</string>
  <string id="6122">He wrote you a letter a few days before his death. It seems he knew what was going to happen to him.</string>
  <string id="6123">A letter? Do you have it with you?</string>
  <string id="6124">No, I keep it at home. I didn't expect you to turn up so soon. I'll give it to you tomorrow and tell you everything I know... Somewhere quiet. And there’s also a biometric safe. I don’t know what's inside, but it must be something valuable.</string>
  <string id="6125">Thank you, George. I don't know how to thank you...</string>
  <string id="6126">Don't mention it, Evan. Your father was good to me. This is the least I can do for you.</string>
  <string id="6127">Ask about the project</string>
  <string id="6128">What was this Heimdall project?</string>
  <string id="6129">Not here, not now! It's too dangerous. We have to find a quiet place and the right time. How about tomorrow?</string>
  <string id="6130">I'll tell you everything, and you can decide what to do with the information.</string>
  <string id="6131">-&gt;$12377</string>
  <string id="6132">Thanks for telling me about my father, George.</string>
  <string id="6133">We'll have time to talk some more. See you tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="6134">End conversation</string>
  <string id="6595">Dear compatriots and friends!</string>
  <string id="6596">We have all gathered here today, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, for a very special occasion! We are here to reward someone.</string>
  <string id="6597">Our country is big, unique and beautiful! We are united by common concerns and common pleasures. We are also united by our long-standing tradition of rewarding the worthy among us, and wishing them the very best.</string>
  <string id="6598">And today that worthy individual is your colleague, Comrade Hemnitz!</string>
  <string id="6599">It is vitally important that we believe in ourselves, in our own strength, and in our country. We work, and in doing so we achieve many great things.</string>
  <string id="6600">I would like to sincerely thank you, dear friends, for your all you victories and achievements, your understanding and trust, and your genuine, heartfelt concern for our Great State!</string>
  <string id="6601">Today, every one of us can become a little better!</string>
  <string id="6602">To achieve this, all we need to do is treat our parents with love and gratitude, give our children and family the attention and care they deserve, respect our colleagues, cherish our friends, defend truth and justice, be merciful, and help those in need of support.</string>
  <string id="6603">But most importantly, we must never betray the cause of our Great Nation! After all, each of us is rewarded according to their deeds!</string>
  <string id="6604">All hail our Great State! Peace and prosperity to our great Motherland! I wish you happiness, health, and prosperity! Hurrah!</string>
  <string id="6136">It’s good to see you, Evan! Do you remember me?</string>
  <string id="6137">-&gt;$6277</string>
  <string id="6138">Of course I do, James.</string>
  <string id="6139">You used to visit us all the time when I was a kid.</string>
  <string id="6140">That's right! You must have been about fourteen the last time we met.</string>
  <string id="6141">But you’re a full-grown man now! It's a pity your father isn’t here to see it.</string>
  <string id="6142">-&gt;$6705</string>
  <string id="6143">I don't remember you.</string>
  <string id="6144">I'm an old friend of your father's, Evan.</string>
  <string id="6145">He and I were friends, and we worked side by side for many years. I visited your home often - don't you remember?</string>
  <string id="6146">Your mother used to make fantastic rhubarb pies!</string>
  <string id="6147">She passed away a long time ago.</string>
  <string id="6148">I know. I went to her funeral... And to your father’s.</string>
  <string id="6149">Why didn't you tell me? I didn’t get a chance to say my goodbyes...</string>
  <string id="6150">I'm afraid your father's death is a complicated matter... And someone at the top wanted to sweep it under the rug as quickly as possible.</string>
  <string id="6151">That's why I came to you. We need to talk about your work.</string>
  <string id="6152">How's your first day going?</string>
  <string id="6153">Everything's moving very quickly. Just a week ago I was planning to visit my father and introduce him to my family. In the end, I didn’t even make it to his funeral.</string>
  <string id="6154">I understand, Evan. Did you two ever patch things up?</string>
  <string id="6155">No. We never got the chance.</string>
  <string id="6156">I’m sorry. If I’d known that things were that bad, I would have arranged your transfer here much sooner.</string>
  <string id="6157">So you’re the one who got me assigned to the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="6158">I am indeed. And by now you might have guessed that it wasn’t down to your good looks and winning smile.</string>
  <string id="6159">Did you come here alone? Where is your family?</string>
  <string id="6160">Everything’s okay. They’re with Miriam’s parents in Redding at the moment.</string>
  <string id="6161">Redding? There’s hardly anything there apart from coal mines and some pretty unpleasant miner types. Not the best place for a woman and her child.</string>
  <string id="6162">I realize that. I have to get the new apartment ready for them as soon as possible.</string>
  <string id="6163">Okay, I’m ready to answer your questions.</string>
  <string id="6164">-&gt;$9510</string>
  <string id="6165">Why am I working here? Why did you move me?</string>
  <string id="6166">Well, you see, I need a man inside the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="6167">But why? If you can arrange a transfer like mine so easily, then surely you must have plenty of insiders there already. I assume my father was one of them?</string>
  <string id="6168">First of all, getting you this job wasn’t easy at all. Second, I need a man I can trust.</string>
  <string id="6169">What for?</string>
  <string id="6170">I’m the head of the department that monitors the authorities. The I.I.D.</string>
  <string id="6171">The Internal Investigations Division?</string>
  <string id="6172">Exactly right. And my main goal is to find out which of our top officials truly serve the people, and which ones bring shame upon the name of our Great Leader. That kind of information can be obtained only with the help of an insider.</string>
  <string id="6173">That’s why I need you. Slowly but surely, you’re going to climb your way up the career ladder from the very bottom - and shine a light into every one of the Ministry’s dark corners.</string>
  <string id="6175">-&gt;$6174</string>
  <string id="6176">Tell me about the apartment.</string>
  <string id="6177">It’s a typical mid-level ministerial apartment. I sorted it out for you.</string>
  <string id="6178">What about my father’s property?</string>
  <string id="6179">It’s been seized while the investigation's ongoing. You know, Evan, I wouldn’t get my hopes up.</string>
  <string id="6180">And the apartment we lived in back when my mother was still alive?</string>
  <string id="6181">I’m afraid some new tenants have already moved in. I’m sorry.</string>
  <string id="6182">Vultures...</string>
  <string id="6183">Do I own this apartment?</string>
  <string id="6184">No, Evan. You can live in it for as long as you work for the Ministry. You still have to pay the bills - otherwise you’ll be sleeping on the street.</string>
  <string id="6185">As an undercover agent for the I.I.D., you’re going to have to play by the rules to avoid unwanted attention.</string>
  <string id="6186">I’ll pay your bills today, but from tomorrow on you’ll have to take care of them yourself.</string>
  <string id="6187">The Ministry of Housing is extremely strict, as you know. Even a minor debt will get you arrested. One has to show due respect for labor, communal property and all that stuff.</string>
  <string id="6188">Plus, there are 603 people waiting in line for this apartment. I checked.</string>
  <string id="6190">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="6191">-&gt;$6757</string>
  <string id="6192">Today I met one of my colleagues, George Hemnitz.</string>
  <string id="6193">He told me a lot about my father. Apparently, they were close friends.</string>
  <string id="6194">I know the name. Yes, they worked together.</string>
  <string id="6195">Did Hemnitz tell you anything important?</string>
  <string id="6196">Tell him about the letter</string>
  <string id="6197">He said my father had written a letter for me.</string>
  <string id="6198">That is very interesting, Evan. Where is this letter? I’d like to see it!</string>
  <string id="6199">Hemnitz is bringing it tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="6200">Let me know when you have it. It’s important! And try to find out as much as you can from him.</string>
  <string id="6201">Tell him about the Heimdall project</string>
  <string id="6202">He said that he and my father worked on a project called Heimdall, in Department 6.</string>
  <string id="6203">I know about Department 6, but I've never heard of that project.</string>
  <string id="6204">He only mentioned it in passing. He promised to tell me the details somewhere quiet tomorrow.</string>

  <string id="6208">-&gt;$13993</string>
  <string id="6209">James, do you know anything about my father’s death?</string>
  <string id="6210">Not much. The floor bosses were involved in some way. That's all I know. And I can't conduct a full investigation.</string>
  <string id="6211">Why not? Investigations are what you and your division do!</string>
  <string id="6212">Evan, the only insider I had in the Ministry was your father. Clearly, he discovered something very important and got taken out for it.</string>
  <string id="6213">All the evidence disappears if we just walk in the front door. Meaning that my investigation into the Ministry and your investigation into your father’s death are one and the same.</string>
  <string id="6214">-&gt;$6715</string>
  <string id="6215">I want to help you.</string>
  <string id="6216">Happy to hear it. Find some dirt on those bastards in the Ministry, and find out who’s responsible for your father’s death. I’ll make sure they get the punishment they deserve.</string>
  <string id="6217">Criticize Cunningham</string>
  <string id="6218">Why the hell haven’t you done it yourself?!</string>
  <string id="6219">My hands are tied! My division can’t touch the Ministry. But I did manage to get you a good position here.</string>
  <string id="6220">Honestly, Evan, you don’t have a lot of options. It’s too late to undo your job transfer.</string>
  <string id="6221">Of course, you could always go in there and only do the work you’re asked to do, like the rest of those chair warmers.</string>
  <string id="6222">But how will be able to look your daughter in the eye when she grows up and realizes that you’re the one who left her such a rotten world?</string>

  <string id="6943">What happened here? I've been bringing reports to the Ministry of Distribution for the last three days. I missed everything.</string>
  <string id="6944">They say Redgrave fell out a window yesterday! Do you know who he was?</string>
  <string id="6945">Of course I do! He was one of the big wigs. How could something like that happen?</string>
  <string id="6946">No idea. You'd better not dwell on it.</string>
  <string id="6947">Thorin saw him fall! Right from the top floor, he says! First some shards of glass came raining down, then...</string>
  <string id="6948">Holy shit! Heads must have rolled after that, eh?</string>
  <string id="6949">No, Phil. Everything’s been quiet. They declared a mourning period as usual. And that's even scarier, you know?</string>

  <string id="6952">Don't say that! I just... I didn't mean...</string>
  <string id="6953">Let's get out of here.</string>

  <string id="8130">What about his salary?</string>
  <string id="8131">Well, he bought himself a gold watch yesterday to see who comes late for work!</string>

  <string id="8138">... If you need it that badly, just take some of mine. I’ve got two rolls of the stuff.</string>
  <string id="8139">That’s not what I meant when I said that someone stole my scotch...</string>

  <string id="8142">I don't read Today, I read Tomorrow!</string>

  <string id="8144">Got a couple hundred to last ‘til Saturday?</string>
  <string id="8145">Yeah, I’m all set, don’t you worry.</string>

  <string id="8156">With his Authority and his salary, Dick suits him better!</string>
  <string id="8157">Grabowski, you're a bloody layabout and a parasite! How the hell did you manage to make so many mistakes in one day!?</string>
  <string id="8158">By coming in early and sticking strictly to the plan, boss!</string>
  <string id="11695">They say there’s going to be a new directive to ban catching flies!</string>
  <string id="11696">What are you worried about? It’s not like you go around catching flies anyways!</string>
  <string id="11697">Yeah, but I choose not to do it of my own free will. I don’t need a directive telling me what not to do!</string>
  <string id="11698">I heard that our department is being downsized by 40%! What happened?</string>
  <string id="11699">Relax! The boss just had a fight with his wife again and threatened to fire all her relatives. Same old story.</string>
  <string id="11700">I ran out of hot water while I was taking a shower yesterday!</string>
  <string id="11701">Oh no! Was something broken?</string>
  <string id="11702">No, I used up my allotment. It’s going to be a long, cold wait until next quarter...</string>
  <string id="11703">You write rejections with a red pen, resolutions with a blue one, and notes with a green one! What’s not to understand?</string>
  <string id="11704">Where do I write them?</string>
  <string id="11705">I heard that they uncovered a spy network in the statistics department!</string>
  <string id="11706">How?!</string>
  <string id="11707">They all got food poisoning from contraband sausage! And wherever there’s contraband, there must be spies. You just have to put two and two together!</string>
  <string id="11708">I got a pay rise!</string>
  <string id="11709">Congratulations!</string>
  <string id="11710">Thanks. Now I’m earning 0.8 times more! Do you think it will be enough for me to buy a new suit?</string>
  <string id="11711">I don't want to upset you... But probably not.</string>
  <string id="11712">My entire salary was taken to buy war bonds! How will I feed my kids?</string>
  <string id="11713">Hush, someone will hear you!</string>
  <string id="11714">Yes, sorry... But how can I look them in the eyes now?</string>
  <string id="11715">Why were you late today?</string>
  <string id="11716">There was this woman who set off the alarm at one of the checkpoints. They stripped her right down to her underwear then and there, in front of everyone! It, er, took me a little longer than usual to get through...</string>
  <string id="11717">Ah, I heard about that! The guards who stripped her down already got what was coming to them. Turns out she’s the daughter of the third floor boss!</string>
  <string id="11718">...found it in the trash. So he was arrested on the spot!</string>
  <string id="11719">What, they check the trash cans too?</string>
  <string id="11720">Didn’t you know?</string>
  <string id="11721">It's raining again today, and I forgot my umbrella!</string>
  <string id="11722">Hopefully they’ll cancel that rally in support of the Leader! I don't want to get wet.</string>
  <string id="11723">I wouldn’t count on it. They always go ahead with the rallies, whatever the weather - you shouldn’t forget that!</string>
  <string id="11724">Did you see the new monument to the Leader in the square? What a monstrosity!</string>
  <string id="11725">Are you nuts? I’m going to pretend I didn't hear that!</string>
  <string id="6287">Beat it! I have no time to waste on you!</string>
  <string id="6288">Look what the cat dragged in! Eyes burning, chest all puffed out. This must be the newcomer the dearly departed Hemnitz was schlepping around the office yesterday.</string>
  <string id="6289">Do you know the most important thing you have to figure out during your first days in the office, rookie?</string>
  <string id="6290">What?</string>
  <string id="6291">It's who you are, buddy. Are you a wombat or a sun bear?</string>
  <string id="6292">Wombat</string>
  <string id="6293">I'm a wombat... whatever that means.</string>
  <string id="6294">I knew you were just a dumb ol' herbivore! So you'll be hiding your fat ass in your burrow while the others fight for a place in the sun, huh?</string>
  <string id="6295">Sun bear</string>
  <string id="6296">I'm a sun bear... Whatever that means.</string>
  <string id="6297">So am I. Smart choice! We're small, but highly dangerous. And we're a dying breed in this office full of wombats!</string>
  <string id="6298">I believe that predators like us should stick together to keep the herbivore population under control.</string>
  <string id="6299">What the...?</string>
  <string id="6300">Wombat? Sun bear? What the hell are you talking about?!</string>
  <string id="6301">It's an elementary question, buddy! Are you a fat and harmless marsupial hiding in a hole? Or a strong and dangerous bear that can take on even a tiger?</string>
  <string id="6302">You office monkeys are so ignorant! Haven't any of you been to Austrania or Nalaysia?</string>
  <string id="6303">Have you?</string>
  <string id="6304">Ah, well, uh... no. But my father often traveled there and told me some things... He promised to take me with him some day, but...</string>
  <string id="6305">It's a long story! So, buddy, are you a herbivore or a predator?</string>
  <string id="6306">Predator</string>
  <string id="6307">Herbivore</string>

  <string id="6370">Which ways?</string>
  <string id="6371">Well, I'd planned to hit on the boss’s daughter and use her to move higher up. It didn't work.</string>
  <string id="6372">-&gt;$6661</string>
  <string id="6373">Because, my friend, for this brilliant plan to work, the boss would need to have a daughter.</string>
  <string id="6375">It's a rat race! Look around you - whiners, losers, girls past their prime and other dregs of humanity. May they live happily and die majestically. Tomorrow, preferably.</string>
  <string id="6377">-&gt;$6376</string>
  <string id="6378">What does your family think about your work?</string>
  <string id="6380">And your wife?</string>
  <string id="6382">Leave that shit to the ones who're too old to have fun.</string>
  <string id="6383">-&gt;$11237</string>
  <string id="6384">Tell me about the people who work here.</string>
  <string id="6385">What do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="6386">Talk about Peter Dong</string>
  <string id="6387">Why don't you like Peter?</string>
  <string id="6388">Me? Don't like that wombat? I adore him! All those sincere little emotions of his are priceless!</string>
  <string id="6389">I don't think he likes that.</string>
  <string id="6390">Buddy, we're living in the most democratic state in the world, where everyone is free to mock their compatriots as much as they like.</string>
  <string id="6391">That goes for everyone, you understand? Nobody's stopping Dong from getting his own back.</string>
  <string id="6392">But he can't, isn't that obvious?</string>
  <string id="6393">That's the beauty of it, man. I get to do all the mocking for the both of us!</string>
  <string id="6394">-&gt;$6680</string>
  <string id="6395">What do you think of Emma?</string>
  <string id="6396">She's a rare breed!</string>
  <string id="6399">Don't get me wrong. She's nice to look at, especially from behind.</string>
  <string id="6401">Have you got a thing for her?</string>
  <string id="6403">Well, well... Listen, buddy! If you're into dumb single moms looking for a husband, go for it!</string>
  <string id="6404">-&gt;$6688</string>
  <string id="6405">What do you think of Magda Rakovich?</string>
  <string id="6406">The Gorgon? I'd quite happily run her over with a tank.</string>
  <string id="6407">Why the hostility towards her?</string>
  <string id="6408">When you have to work with a colleague like that, you'll understand! That's if she doesn't just devour you whole along with all the other shit. She's ruined so many careers! Too many to count.</string>
  <string id="6409">But she's just a secretary, isn't she?</string>
  <string id="6410">She's got the boss wrapped around her little finger. I'm pretty sure he's afraid of her. And everyone needs to remember that.</string>
  <string id="6411">If I didn't like you, I ‘d have suggested that you tell her to go screw herself on your first day. And I would've enjoyed watching her rip your guts out.</string>
  <string id="6412">Talk about the boss</string>
  <string id="6413">What do you think about the boss?</string>
  <string id="6414">He's not a girl. Why should I think anything about him at all?</string>
  <string id="6415">But we report to him...</string>
  <string id="6416">Marco Legrand reports only to himself! And it's just a matter of time until that fat sack of shit gets what's coming to him. I'll be taking his place soon, you'll see!</string>
  <string id="6417">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="6418">-&gt;$6697</string>
  <string id="6420">-&gt;$6419</string>
  <string id="6421">No. I had no need to. If he'd had a juicy daughter instead of a scrawny son, if he hadn't decided to put his flying skills to the test, if I worked several floors higher... then he would've been of interest to me.</string>
  <string id="6422">That's a few too many “ifs”, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="6423">I've got one more for you: if my father was dead, I'd be living it up off my inheritance - and I wouldn't shed a single tear.</string>
  <string id="6424">Talk about promotion</string>
  <string id="6425">Why do you want a promotion?</string>
  <string id="6426">I like the boss's office. I'll be able to summon the bad girls there and give them a real dressing down. A real dressing down, I said. Hahaha! Get it? That's funny, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="6459">-&gt;$6760</string>
  <string id="6460">Didn't you see?</string>
  <string id="6461">I did, but I'm not sure I understand...</string>
  <string id="6462">There's nothing to understand. He might've failed to meet his quota or had some problems with the boss. The main thing is that there's no more Hemnitz.</string>
  <string id="6463">Ask about the biometric safe</string>
  <string id="6464">Did you happen to see a biometric safe in his hands?</string>
  <string id="6466">Where is it?</string>
  <string id="6467">Not so fast, buddy. I'm not your postman - nobody pays me to deliver your mail. I have a great idea! Poor Peter Dong seems pretty upset about Hemnitz. Looks like he’s about to cry. And who are we if not sympathetic colleagues? I think we should try and cheer him up. Let's play a little prank on him!</string>
  <string id="6468">Us?</string>
  <string id="6469">Yeah! But you do the pranking, and we both do the laughing. You want the safe, don't you? So let's get on with it! Take Dong for a ride and it's yours! Fair and square!</string>
  <string id="6470">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="6477">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="6478">I put beetles in his desk. You must have heard him screaming.</string>
  <string id="6479">His cries are a sweet melody to these ears! Poor Peter's afraid of a couple of ordinary bugs! Good job, Redgrave!</string>
  <string id="6480">Dong drank coffee laced with a laxative. Next time I'll hang an “Out of Service” sign on the toilet door.</string>
  <string id="6481">I love these little japes! They really let us see how people open up and let loose.</string>
  <string id="6482">Open up? Let loose? Get it? Hahahaha!</string>
  <string id="6483">Now I can call him Peter the Excreter!</string>
  <string id="6484">I sent a love letter to Hazer from Dong's terminal!</string>
  <string id="6485">Oh yeah! That was cool! Peter went so red I thought he was going to catch fire, and I nearly died laughing!</string>
  <string id="6486">I have a great idea for a prank! Everyone knows that Dong is crazy about Emma. We have to use that, man! Here's what you do: persuade Hazer to invite Dong into the toilets to fool around. And then pull his pants down! That'll be hilarious!</string>
  <string id="6487">It certainly will. I'll talk to Emma and find a way to persuade her.</string>
  <string id="6488">Great, buddy!</string>
  <string id="6489">I think that's going too far! I'm out.</string>
  <string id="6490">Are you afraid, chicken? You disappoint me.</string>
  <string id="6491">I did what we agreed on.</string>
  <string id="6492">Yeah, that was fun. He ran through the office in his underpants! I almost pissed myself laughing!</string>
  <string id="6495">You're awesome! I even feel sorry for Peter. Well... A little bit sorry. But it's the law of nature. Someone must suffer to make us happy.</string>
  <string id="6498">When was the last time you had a look at the entrance the Ministry? Whatever value your name once had was scraped off the sidewalk long ago.</string>
  <string id="6499">Hey buddy. The way I see it, you're a good guy, but not that great with money. Want some help?</string>
  <string id="6500">No, thanks. I don't borrow money from my colleagues.</string>
  <string id="6501">You're a proud kind of guy! I like that.</string>
  <string id="6502">Who says I'm offering you money? I'm offering you business. I need to get something into the Ministry without anyone finding out. You help me, and I help you.</string>
  <string id="6503">You mentioned some business.</string>
  <string id="6504">I did. So, will you help me with a little tiny bit of smuggling?</string>
  <string id="6505">Tell me.</string>
  <string id="6506">Alright, man! There are these substances that relieve fatigue and make people cheerful. They aren't what you'd call legal, but they're highly effective. There's a demand here - these people are working themselves to death.</string>
  <string id="6507">My dealer's outside, my customers are inside, and the entrance guards are between them. Got it?</string>
  <string id="6508">But how do I bring them inside?</string>
  <string id="6509">You figure it out! Make a deal with someone or try it yourself, if you're not a coward. I'll pay you well.</string>
  <string id="6512">Let's talk about it later.</string>
  <string id="6513">So, did you cut a deal with someone? Or just decide to do the job yourself?</string>
  <string id="6514">Peddler</string>
  <string id="6515">I arranged it with Serena Marwitz, the peddler. She's going to hide it between her buns and bring it in.</string>
  <string id="6516">The ones she sells or those hard old ones under her skirt? Hahaha! Whatever. She's gotta do what she's gotta do.</string>
  <string id="6517">Come back tomorrow, we'll see how it goes.</string>
  <string id="6518">Guard</string>
  <string id="6519">I arranged everything with the guard at the entrance.</string>
  <string id="6520">Good. We'll discuss it tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="6521">Do it yourself</string>
  <string id="6522">I'll do it myself.</string>
  <string id="6523">My dealer'll be waiting for you at the entrance tomorrow. He'll give you the medicine. You'll give it to me.</string>
  <string id="6525">I need a little more time to think.</string>
  <string id="6526">Don't take too long, buddy.</string>
  <string id="6527">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="6528">How would you like to improve your financial status?</string>
  <string id="6529">-&gt;$7198</string>
  <string id="6530">Do you need the money or don't you? There's a nice n' easy little job for you. You don't even have to leave the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="6531">What do I need to do?</string>
  <string id="6532">Listen up. Our colleagues are good people, but awful clients for my business! They prefer living clean and healthy, they refuse to smoke or drink, and they love the Leader.</string>
  <string id="6533">I love the Leader too.</string>
  <string id="6534">Everyone loves the Leader! But I've got a whole batch of drugs that shouldn't sit around here for too long, understand?</string>
  <string id="6538">-&gt;$6537</string>
  <string id="6539">The problem is that our workaholic colleagues are afraid to try them. I need you to tell them how just how beautiful the world looks after taking a dose.</string>
  <string id="6540">So, should I put up flyers or what?</string>
  <string id="6541">You're close. As you know, my father is a big cheese in the coal business, and he got me the job here - which means I'm under supervision.</string>
  <string id="6542">You're a whole different kettle of fish. You're not well-known and you have an honest, trustworthy face. Like on one of those “The Father-Leader needs YOU!” posters.</string>
  <string id="6543">Talk to your colleagues, tell a couple of stories about how these vitamins improve your performance, potency, cup size, whatever...</string>
  <string id="6544">Vitamins?</string>
  <string id="6545">Vitamins, gummy bears, whatever it takes! Anything will do! I need a market, man, and I hope you can provide it.</string>
  <string id="6546">If anyone's interested, sell them the medicine and then send them on to me. Keep the money for yourself. Here you go.</string>
  <string id="6547">I don't have time.</string>
  <string id="6548">Come back when you're free.</string>
  <string id="6554">Take it! With a second's hesitation! You'll never earn honest money here. Our salaries aren't enough to live on, unless you've got a rich dad to support you - like me.</string>
  <string id="6556">And do you take bribes?</string>
  <string id="6557">Well, I never refuse to help people if they ask politely, haha!</string>
  <string id="6558">And most importantly, buddy, you don't have to send every last penny up to the top. Something might just stick to your hands, if you know what I mean.</string>
  <string id="6559">Ask about theft</string>
  <string id="6562">Don't they get caught?</string>
  <string id="6563">They can get caught if they say the wrong thing about the Leader, but not for anything as trivial as theft. On that topic, this badge used to be Dong's.</string>
  <string id="6564">You stole it?</string>
  <string id="6565">Yup. I'd hoped to make him angry and have a bit of fun. But that loser just burst into tears.</string>
  <string id="6589">-&gt;$6646</string>
  <string id="6590">-&gt;$6644</string>
  <string id="6591">-&gt;$6649</string>
  <string id="6593">Get out, kid!</string>
  <string id="6594">Uh-huh</string>
  <string id="6967">Anyway, welcome to our snake pit! We'll soon see what you are.</string>
  <string id="6968">I wonder - will you grow long claws and a hard shell or offer up that soft, fluffy belly for someone else to sink their teeth into.</string>
  <string id="6969">-&gt;$6634</string>
  <string id="6970">Have a nice day.</string>
  <string id="6971">And you.</string>
  <string id="8847">Discuss The Walking Boreans</string>
  <string id="8848">Tell him about the pranks</string>
  <string id="8849">Talk about pranks on Dong</string>
  <string id="8850">Refuse to prank</string>
  <string id="8851">Talk about the biometric safe</string>
  <string id="8852">Give the envelope from the man on the street</string>
  <string id="9002">Talk about business</string>
  <string id="8853">Talk about stimulants</string>
  <string id="8854">Tell about the confiscation of stimulants</string>
  <string id="8855">Ask what happened</string>
  <string id="8856">-&gt;$8357</string>
  <string id="8857">What? Have you been messing around with her, man? I'm sure that wasn't too difficult. She's very open to... ahem... making new acquaintances.</string>
  <string id="8858">I watched an episode of The Walking Boreans. What an epic show!</string>
  <string id="8859">Did you see how Sgutich's group purged that brothel at the border? It was so awesome!</string>
  <string id="8860">And you know what the best part is? I’ve been there! Can you believe it? I visited that place - it really exists!</string>
  <string id="8861">-&gt;$7606</string>
  <string id="8862">Of course! I went to the capital with my pops, and while the old man went about his business, I spent the whole time in that brothel!</string>
  <string id="8863">By the way, I didn’t get how that infection detector is supposed to work? I thought the antipatriotism virus couldn’t be detected.</string>
  <string id="8864">Does it matter? You’re too smart for your own good, Redgrave!</string>
  <string id="8865">I’m just having some fun! It caught my attention, that’s all - that show is really good!</string>
  <string id="8866">Something awesome happens in every episode!</string>
  <string id="8867">Didn't we have a deal? You have to prank Dong! He’ll cry with shame, I’ll cry with joy, and you’ll cry with happiness after getting the letter. Everyone wins!</string>
  <string id="8868">Is there no other way?</string>
  <string id="8869">There is…</string>
  <string id="8870">Tell me!</string>
  <string id="8871">That's no fun! Can't the “son of Redgrave” think of something on his own?</string>
  <string id="8872">You don't want to play a prank on Dong - then I don't want to give you the mini-safe.</string>
  <string id="8873">But I need it!</string>
  <string id="8874">And I need a promotion!</string>
  <string id="8875">Well I can’t do anything about that!</string>
  <string id="8876">With your standing in the Ministry? Don't make me laugh!</string>
  <string id="8878">Legrand always keeps his word! There you go! You've earned it!</string>
  <string id="8879">Persuade him to give you the biometric safe</string>
  <string id="8881">Do you really want to mess with “the son of Redgrave”? Why don't you just give me the safe and let’s be done with it.</string>
  <string id="8882">A bit jumpy, aren’t we? You must have ratted me out to security already!</string>
  <string id="8883">I can deal with my problems on my own...</string>
  <string id="8884">Atta boy! Fine, take your safe. I’ve had enough of this anyway… I couldn't open it.</string>
  <string id="8885">Marco, give me the safe. It’s very important to me.</string>
  <string id="8886">Do you remember what Colonel Sgutich said when he broke into that brothel in The Walking Boreans?</string>
  <string id="8888">-&gt;$8887</string>
  <string id="8889">“You bitches are too nice to mess around with!”, Hahaha! Take your little box, buddy, I don't need it!</string>
  <string id="8890">Although those “bitches” did nearly eat him alive a second later...</string>
  <string id="8891">Evan, do you remember what Colonel Sgutich said when he broke into that brothel in The Walking Boreans?</string>
  <string id="8892">He said: “Everything has a price, even a knuckle sandwich!”.</string>
  <string id="8893">And what does that have to do with the letter?</string>
  <string id="8894">You're a good guy, Evan, and so am I - somewhere deep down... But I can't give you this box just like that. It goes against my principles!</string>
  <string id="8895">You look gloomy today, did something happen?</string>
  <string id="8896">Huh? That old man is driving me crazy with his bloody calls! He called me at work to find out how I'm doing here.</string>
  <string id="8897">Wait, what old man? Tell me exactly who called you and what happened.</string>
  <string id="8898">My father! He's pestering me about marriage and children. Decrepit old prick! Says I can forget about my inheritance until I get married and give him some grandchildren!</string>
  <string id="8899">That's rough!</string>
  <string id="8900">Well, I think I'll go back to work.</string>
  <string id="8901">Wait! I have an idea! Call my old man and tell him that I have a girlfriend and we’re getting married soon! He won't believe me, but your surname should be enough to convince him!</string>
  <string id="8902">I don't really want to.</string>
  <string id="8903">I'll pay you!</string>
  <string id="8904">-&gt;$9576</string>
  <string id="8906">Fine! Give me the money and the phone number.</string>
  <string id="8907">Here! The old geezer's name is Henry.</string>
  <string id="8908">Tell Legrand about the “present” from Hazer</string>
  <string id="8909">-&gt;$9004</string>
  <string id="8910">-&gt;$9913</string>
  <string id="8911">TV shows? Why, The Walking Boreans, of course!</string>
  <string id="8912">Haven't heard of it…</string>
  <string id="8913">Are you for real? It’s the best show of all time!</string>
  <string id="8914">What is it about?</string>
  <string id="8915">Well, the Boreans have planted saboteurs among our ranks who go around biting people, and everyone they bite becomes a Borean! Just imagine! You wake up one morning surrounded by Boreans and you get to shoot them with a shotgun! Cool, right?</string>
  <string id="8916">Wow! And how do you tell a Borean from a non-Borean?</string>
  <string id="8917">Haven't you read the bulletins from the Ministry of Truth? It’s all in there!</string>
  <string id="8918">Well, yeah… So what’s the plot?</string>
  <string id="8919">Well, there's this big tough guy called Sgutich - every episode he beats the shit out of someone. I love it! Blood and teeth flying all over the place! And at the end he always says: “The Leader will be pleased!”. I love that guy!</string>
  <string id="8920">Long story short, we went back to my place, and she's all fluttering her eyelids and saying stuff like: “Where's your salmon?” Well, I'm no fool. I opened a year-old can of sprats, and we were “feeding” them with breadcrumbs for half an hour. Can you believe that?</string>
  <string id="8921">There's no secret to it, buddy. Have a swig of something strong, and your tongue'll loosen up.</string>
  <string id="8922">How is it here, in general?</string>
  <string id="8923">My wife? I only deal with other people's wives. Haha! No way am I gonna to put a collar on with some inscription like “This turkey was ringed on whatever day of whatever month.”</string>
  <string id="8924">It was fun messing around with him, and now that he’s gone, it means that I won't be here much longer either.</string>
  <string id="8925">Why’s that?</string>
  <string id="8926">I’m one step closer to promotion.</string>
  <string id="8927">Seriously? I must’ve misheard you, because it sounded like you just said a good word about someone.</string>
  <string id="8928">You just didn’t let me finish, buddy! What makes her rare is that she’s the only woman I know who looks better with her mouth closed instead of open.</string>
  <string id="8929">Every time she starts talking, I start wanting to throw up or drown myself in some cheap booze - anything to escape her whining and constant babbling on about TV shows.</string>
  <string id="8930">Just asking.</string>
  <string id="8931">I heard Emma left the office.</string>
  <string id="8932">She sure did! Swindled my old man and now she’s running things in my home! She even brought her children. Apparently, all he can think about in his old age is having kids.</string>
  <string id="8933">Well, you told me yourself that he wanted grandchildren. I guess the old man decided to take matters into his own hands.</string>
  <string id="8934">Curse his hands! I went to visit them recently... I mean, do you understand?! I was a guest in my own home! I stayed with them for a couple of hours and aged a couple of years!</string>
  <string id="8935">And he just looks around happily and says how cozy the place has gotten, with the children running around and laughing! I can still hear the laughter and the trampling of feet ringing in my ears. He even gave them my room!</string>
  <string id="8936">And this Hazer. Am I supposed to call her mom now? She was flirting with me not that long ago... Or was that just my imagination?</string>
  <string id="8937">Of course, now there’s one less candidate for the promotion, but what's the point now? The old man’s probably already added Emma's bastards to his will.</string>
  <string id="8938">You mean you don’t want a promotion anymore?</string>
  <string id="8939">You wish! A promotion is now the only thing that can save me from being stuck in this hole.</string>
  <string id="8944">Although it's a shame... I came up with such a great prank, but it won't work without Hazer.</string>
  <string id="8945">Yeah, I’ve heard! She found herself a man and went to live with him in some village. Well, good riddance! At least she won't be an eyesore around here any longer and won't be shaking her ass in front of our superiors! I know how she got their attention!</string>
  <string id="8946">Really? Well, that's great! One less competitor for promotion! Not that I was worried about her - that dumb wench was no match for me - but you know what I mean, right?</string>
  <string id="8947">The great news is that I won't have to get my hands dirty. I swear, just a little while longer and I would have strangled her with my bare hands!</string>
  <string id="8948">Hemnitz asked me get a letter and a biometric safe from his belongings when he was being taken away. But I only just remembered about the letter.</string>
  <string id="8949">My sense of humor isn't as refined or subtle as yours.</string>
  <string id="8950">Emotions are the key. Find Dong's weaknesses and take advantage of them.</string>
  <string id="8951">I refuse.</string>
  <string id="8952">Think about it carefully. Don’t you want this wonderful little box, complete with fingerprint scanner?</string>
  <string id="8953">-&gt;$9603</string>
  <string id="8954">-&gt;$8534</string>
  <string id="8955">I thought you were a predator, but you’re just another herbivore.</string>
  <string id="8956">Refuse and insult</string>
  <string id="8957">Your pranks are shitty, just like your haircut and personality.</string>
  <string id="8958">You shouldn't really talk to me like that…</string>
  <string id="8959">Hey, you're not so bad. But I'm still better! Come by tomorrow, I'll tell you how to play some pranks on Peter!</string>
  <string id="8960">Marco, I was thinking... I don't want to prank Peter, I'm sorry. He’s a nice guy and he’s done nothing wrong to me.</string>
  <string id="8961">Aww... Just look at that, our herbivore’s getting all wimpy!</string>
  <string id="8963">-&gt;$9007</string>
  <string id="8964">I see! I thought you were a predator, but you're a dumb herbivore... chewing away without a clue!</string>

  <string id="8968">Are you insane, Redgrave? Who do you think you're talking to?</string>
  <string id="8969">Destroy him with words</string>
  <string id="8970">You do not know what love or friendship are, and you don’t know how to appreciate kindness.</string>
  <string id="8971">Shut up!</string>
  <string id="8972">You're a stupid cowardly boy who’s hidden behind his father's back his whole life...</string>
  <string id="8973">Even Peter Dong is more respected than you, Marco…</string>
  <string id="8974">No one dares compare me to Dong!</string>
  <string id="8975">Compare you to Dong? Dong is a cut above you in every way! He has much better chances of getting a promotion or a girl than you do.</string>
  <string id="8976">Last warning, jerk!</string>
  <string id="8977">I think your father would have preferred to have Peter Dong as his son. Because he doesn't love you, and never has.</string>

  <string id="8981">Holy shit, Evan! Don't joke with me like that! I almost shot you!</string>
  <string id="8982">Come on, man! That was a good one, wasn't it?</string>
  <string id="8983">Fine. Well played, you son of a bitch! Haha!</string>
  <string id="8984">Change your mind and continue playing pranks</string>
  <string id="8985">A herbivore? Me? Just wait and see what I can do with my pranks... I’ll eat this Dong alive!</string>
  <string id="8986">-&gt;$10737</string>
  <string id="8987">Marco, I failed. They confiscated the goods at the checkpoint. I don't know what I was counting on... luck, probably.</string>
  <string id="8988">Your plan was just to carry the goods through the scanner? If it was that simple, I wouldn't need idiots like you! Well, I suppose we won't be doing business together.</string>
  <string id="8990">Marco, someone asked me to pass an envelope on to you. Here it is.</string>
  <string id="8991">Give him the envelope</string>
  <string id="8992">Thanks for the favor, Evan. You're a fearless guy who knows where not to stick his nose, if you know what I mean.</string>
  <string id="8993">If I were you, I would have poked my nose in that envelope for sure.</string>
  <string id="8994">You opened it? Then you know all about my business.</string>

  <string id="9145">300! That’s all I have.</string>
  <string id="9146">Talk about the inheritance</string>
  <string id="9147">So you’re only working here because of your father’s inheritance, Marco?</string>
  <string id="9148">That’s my business, I’m not going to discuss it with you!</string>
  <string id="9149">Father doesn’t give me any money. I have no choice but to rot in here.</string>
  <string id="9150">Even if the old codger kicks the bucket, I’ll get nothing.</string>
  <string id="9151">I mean, what’s his deal? If only he changed his mind and started giving me money, I’d be outta here in a second - screw the Ministry!</string>
  <string id="9152">I wouldn’t be here at all if it wasn’t for my dear relatives!</string>
  <string id="9153">Hi, Marco! Ferguson told me to collect the money.</string>
  <string id="9154">Are you his errand boy now?</string>
  <string id="9155">It’s not my place to argue with the boss.</string>
  <string id="9156">There’s no arguing with that fat bastard...</string>
  <string id="9157">So what about the money?</string>
  <string id="9158">I don’t have any money. We’re in a recession and the market is stagnating - do you even know that term?</string>
  <string id="9159">Hi, Marco! I need two girls who’d agree to do anything! It’s urgent!</string>
  <string id="9160">Man, me too! Let me know if you find any, okay?</string>
  <string id="9161">I’m serious! Ferguson told me to find him a couple of women for the evening.</string>
  <string id="9162">So, that fat pig has decided to go hog wild, eh?</string>
  <string id="9163">Will you help me or not?</string>
  <string id="9164">Alright, Redgrave! Marco Legrand will save you. And free of charge, for the record! But in return, you tell me everything that goes on in Ferguson’s office, down to the smallest detail. Deal?</string>
  <string id="9165">Do you think Ferguson’s going to let me stay in the office while he’s having his fun? Or should I bug the place?</string>
  <string id="9166">Can you do that?</string>
  <string id="9167">Marco!</string>
  <string id="9168">Just kidding! Here you go, and don’t forget my kindness!</string>

  <string id="9778">Give stimulants</string>

  <string id="9780">You're a bore if you talk about work at work. Basically, everyone steals and takes bribes.</string>
  <string id="9781">Ask what he does</string>
  <string id="9782">If everyone takes bribes, should I do it too?</string>
  <string id="9783">Though I don't have any money coming in either. The well's dried up. But my old man's still alive, unlike yours. Unfortunately.</string>

  <string id="9790">Yeah, did it myself.</string>
  <string id="9791">I don't know how on earth you did it, you lucky bastard.</string>
  <string id="9794">I wouldn't have expected something like that from Dong. His departure was impressive. Now I’ve got no one to mess with...</string>
  <string id="9795">No, I left them somewhere.</string>
  <string id="8989">These rats will take anything that's not nailed to the floor! Though sometimes they take the nails, too.</string>
  <string id="9829">How’s business?</string>
  <string id="9830">Meh. If I start offering stimulants to just anyone, security will shut me down in no time - so I don’t get a lot of clients. And I need a lot of money!</string>
  <string id="10806">-&gt;$10755</string>
  <string id="10807">What’s stopping you from taking his place right now?</string>

  <string id="10810">When you have that much money, Evan, the question “Why?” becomes “Why not?”.</string>
  <string id="10811">I’m not such a fool that I’d sell them myself. Talk to the gardener on the bridge.</string>
  <string id="10812">Hear about the explosion in the new wing? Horrifying, right?</string>
  <string id="10813">Pff, you think that’s horrifying? One time at the brothel they gave me a one-legged, three-breasted “woman” with no front teeth! That explosion is nothing.</string>
  <string id="10814">But people died!</string>
  <string id="10815">So what? People die every day! That Page is really something! They say he spent a whole month assembling the bomb right here in the Ministry. Said it was going to be a portable Shredder.</string>
  <string id="10816">And the bastard wasn’t lying! He shredded himself along with the whole wing! Not bad!</string>

  <string id="6619">-&gt;$8534</string>
  <string id="6620">I didn't ask if you were interested. Reading sealed papers like these when you don't have top secret clearance can cost you your freedom... or your life. Do I make myself clear?</string>
  <string id="6621">Perfectly. But I prefer not to stick my nose into other people's business.</string>
  <string id="6622">I don't care where you stick any of your extremities. There are rules, regulations and instructions that must be observed if you want to stay in the Ministry for more than a day. If you make mistakes, nothing will save you - not even your name.</string>
  <string id="6623">What's wrong with my name?</string>

  <string id="8275">How do you like the weather? The forecast said there would be sun!</string>
  <string id="8276">Meteorology is the scientific justification of false weather forecasts.</string>
  <string id="8277">You don’t believe in weather forecasts?</string>
  <string id="8278">A forecast is something you wait for, and weather is something you have. I don't see any point in idly waiting for anything.</string>

  <string id="8281">Work is not meant to be liked, it is meant to be done.</string>

  <string id="8283">I am Mr. Ferguson's secretary. I hope I don't have to explain to you what this position entails.</string>

  <string id="8293">Ask about workload increase</string>
  <string id="8294">Why’s there such an increase in your workload?</string>
  <string id="8295">Hemnitz is dead - meaning that he can't do his job and therefore must be fired.</string>
  <string id="8296">When an employee is fired, they have to hand over their official stamp and any secret documents they may have. They also have to sign the safety journal, and provide a form saying that they have no books from the Ministry libraries in their possession…</string>
  <string id="8297">But most importantly, he did not hand over his pass.</string>
  <string id="8298">The security service must have his things. Go to the guard at the checkpoint and tell him I sent you. He’ll give you Hemnitz's things.</string>
  <string id="8299">I brought you Hemnitz's pass.</string>
  <string id="8300">Give it to me.</string>
  <string id="8301">Now I can finally fire him. It's good that he didn't have any library books - they’re very strict about that. Now his promotion allotment is open.</string>
  <string id="8302">His promotion allotment?</string>

  <string id="8306">Hello, Magda, I have a question. Do you know of any orphanages that take good care of children?</string>
  <string id="8307">What do you mean “good care”? Every orphanage in our country takes good care of our citizens. If you say something like that again, I’ll fine you and have you undergo a patriotism check!</string>
  <string id="8308">I'm sorry, that came out wrong. Still, what about the orphanages?</string>
  <string id="8309">There was one man recently... He was asking to increase deliveries of children's clothing. He introduced himself as the director of the Cornflower orphanage. Here's his number.</string>
  <string id="8310">-&gt;$9256</string>
  <string id="8324">Give it to me. I will take care of it and find out who lost it. He’ll rue the day he was born!</string>
  <string id="8325">And if you find something like that in the future, bring it directly to me. Do not show it to anyone and don't look inside. It’ll be safer for us both that way.</string>

  <string id="10848">-&gt;$14439</string>
  <string id="10849">Ask how her granddaughter ended up the House of Misfits</string>
  <string id="10850">It’s a story about a whole series of deaths.</string>
  <string id="10851">My husband died first. He rushed to defend his lab assistant when someone from the Ministry of Order came for him. Took a stun gun to the chest. His heart couldn't take it.</string>
  <string id="10852">Then my son-in-law died on the Front. My daughter was expecting a baby at the time. We didn't tell her about him, but she found out somehow...</string>
  <string id="10853">She went into labor prematurely... There were complications, she lost a lot of blood... They couldn't save her.</string>
  <string id="10854">While she was still in the hospital, my granddaughter was diagnosed with diabetes. Under our laws, children with this diagnosis are immediately sent to the House of Misfits.</string>
  <string id="10855">When someone arrives there, they’re given a number and their personal file is made secret. She was taken when she was still a baby. It’s already been several years, so I can’t even imagine what she looks like. I know where she is, but I don't know who she is!</string>
  <string id="10856">All I can do is help all the children in that place, without exception. With money, clothes, medicines. In the hope that some of it will reach my granddaughter.</string>
  <string id="10857">Ask about her daughter</string>
  <string id="10858">Tell me more about your daughter.</string>
  <string id="10859">I cannot and will not discuss her or her idiot husband.</string>
  <string id="10860">How could he leave behind his pregnant wife, volunteer to go to the Front and get himself killed there?!</string>
  <string id="10861">His wife is in the cemetery, and his daughter is in the House of Misfits. He was even awarded the Medal of Heroism. Posthumously.</string>
  <string id="10862">You found my sweetheart! I don’t have to help those useless cripples anymore!</string>
  <string id="10864">-&gt;$10863</string>
  <string id="10865">And where are they?</string>
  <string id="10866">I didn't bring them.</string>
  <string id="10867">Very funny, Redgrave. What else haven’t you done in your worthless life?</string>
  <string id="10868">Take this map of the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="10869">Without it, you’ll be wandering the halls until the end of time.</string>
  <string id="10870">Now Hemnitz's personal file is ready to be transferred to the archive. But...</string>
  <string id="10871">But?</string>
  <string id="10872">But the courier hasn’t brought me all the documents I need for the archive. Yet again. He doesn’t care, and we’re the ones who will be “rewarded” for losing documents that contain state secrets.</string>
  <string id="10873">Look around in the carts by the workplaces. If you find the documents, bring them to me.</string>
  <string id="10874">Magda, you are helping out the House of Misfits?</string>
  <string id="10875">You talk a lot, Evan. That is very bad. For you.</string>
  <string id="10876">Ask about the House of Misfits</string>
  <string id="10877">And what is this House of Misfits?</string>
  <string id="10878">It was built as part of a national cleansing program - to round up every child with disabilities and get it all over with once and for all.</string>
  <string id="10879">No person - no problem! All the sick, disabled and crippled kids are gathered in one place, and everything possible is done to get them to die faster.</string>
  <string id="10880">There is no medicine, no care. There isn’t even wood for heating.</string>
  <string id="10881">-&gt;$6715</string>
  <string id="10882">I feel sorry for those children... If I can help with anything…</string>
  <string id="10883">First of all, never stick your nose into my affairs again. Second... I need food.</string>
  <string id="10884">Food?</string>
  <string id="10885">The children are starving. I had a look at their kitchen - there’s only enough food there for another couple of days. If you can call frozen potatoes food, that is.</string>
  <string id="10886">I have a blank food voucher somewhere, signed by the Minister of Social Care. But I just can’t find it in this pile of papers!</string>
  <string id="10887">If I can pass it on to the House of Misfits, the children will be able to eat normally for months!</string>
  <string id="10888">Maybe I can help you look? Are you sure it's here?</string>
  <string id="10889">-&gt;$13171</string>
  <string id="10890">-&gt;$10737</string>
  <string id="10891">But why are you helping them?</string>
  <string id="10892">I won't answer any questions from someone who pokes his nose into other people's business without asking.</string>
  <string id="10893">I see. So you are helping them?</string>
  <string id="10894">Redgrave, don't you have other things to do? Let me work!</string>
  <string id="10895">What has two thumbs and an excellent eye for detail? This guy! I found the voucher.</string>
  <string id="10896">Excellent! Now none of them will die of hunger.</string>
  <string id="10897">But there’s a more serious problem. A lot of the children have diabetes and need insulin, and nobody in the House of Misfits cares. I bribed the staff - they gave the children injections in secret. But now there’s a problem with the drug itself.</string>
  <string id="10898">-&gt;$6088</string>
  <string id="10899">The national cleansing program has been declared complete, so they no longer bother manufacturing insulin. It's impossible to bring it in from abroad - they search for contraband medicine more actively than they search for explosives.</string>
  <string id="10900">-&gt;$9137</string>
  <string id="10901">The underground labs I worked with have been under a lot of pressure lately. I’ve learned that there’s insulin in one of them, but I can’t go myself - I might be followed.</string>
  <string id="10902">What do you need from me?</string>
  <string id="10903">Meet with the right person and arrange some deliveries. I'll take care of the rest. Can you handle that?</string>
  <string id="10904">What about the insulin?</string>
  <string id="10905">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="10906">Where and when will the meeting take place?</string>
  <string id="10907">You know the old river port on the outskirts of the city? The lab is around there somewhere.</string>
  <string id="10908">That is a very vague description.</string>
  <string id="10909">Unfortunately that’s all I have. My man said that if we need insulin, we’ll find it - and we really need insulin, Evan.</string>
  <string id="10910">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="10911">I’m busy right now.</string>
  <string id="10912">I did everything you asked.</string>
  <string id="10913">And it all went well?</string>
  <string id="10914">In general, yes. Though this scientist is a strange one.</string>
  <string id="10915">He is a genius, though not one recognized by our science...</string>
  <string id="10916">Are you confident in him?</string>
  <string id="10917">In our times, you cannot be confident in anything. I hope that he has good insulin, because I have no alternatives.</string>
  <string id="10918">I hope it’ll all be okay.</string>
  <string id="10919">If you'd been there you’d know that nothing is okay in that place.</string>
  <string id="10920">Why are you so upset? You look terrible!</string>
  <string id="10921">I need soap.</string>
  <string id="10922">-&gt;$9576</string>
  <string id="10923">A lot of it. Several boxes. There was a mix-up in th supply department and they sent the children three boxes of ammunition instead of soap.</string>
  <string id="10924">Now they can shoot themselves, but can’t get off the toilet because there’s a epidemic of dysentery in the building.</string>
  <string id="10925">About helping the House of Misfits...</string>
  <string id="10926">What do you need me to do?</string>
  <string id="10927">Can you make a request to the supply department, so that they correct their mistake?</string>
  <string id="10928">No problem.</string>
  <string id="10929">Not so fast! They only accept requests from Comrade Ferguson’s terminal. I can’t leave my workplace, but I’ll cover for you if I have to. Here’s the number of the House of Misfits in the ministerial databases.</string>
  <string id="10930">Don't worry, I’ll do everything I can.</string>
  <string id="10931">Sorry, but I need to work. Good luck!</string>
  <string id="10932">I sent the request.</string>
  <string id="10933">Excellent!</string>
  <string id="10934">You care so much about all those children!</string>
  <string id="10935">Mostly about the girls, seeing as one of them is my granddaughter.</string>
  <string id="10936">Why don't you take her from there?</string>
  <string id="10937">Children in the House of Misfits are given new names, and their real names are stored under numbers in the Ministry of Information Collection database and in the archive. I have the number that was assigned to her at birth - 214782.</string>
  <string id="10938">And I'm scared. I want to take her home more than anything, but I’ll have to change my whole life.</string>
  <string id="10939">Remember, Evan Redgrave, I'm telling you all of this because you helped me. This is just a moment of weakness.</string>
  <string id="10940">I saw your request, Redgrave! I don’t know what the hell it was you sent to those children, but it wasn’t soap!</string>
  <string id="10941">Fix your mistake and find some soap, or I'll find another use for the rope without it!</string>
  <string id="10942">Did you find a soap supplier?</string>
  <string id="10943">Yes, I did.</string>
  <string id="10944">I found out your granddaughter's new name. It's Nina Rakitich.</string>
  <string id="10945">Evan! It’s a miracle! I can finally take her home, and I don’t have to spend any more money on those defective children!</string>
  <string id="10946">Defective children?</string>
  <string id="10947">That's right! Sick, miserable, crippled, disabled... The scum on the gene pool! Obviously my granddaughter was sent there by mistake. I’m glad I can fix her and get her out of that cesspool.</string>
  <string id="10948">Fix what?</string>
  <string id="10949">Fix everything! All of it!</string>
  <string id="10950">Magda, Comrade Ferguson has ordered me to collect contributions from my colleagues…</string>
  <string id="10951">Contributions? What contributions? To whom? I don’t contribute anything to anyone! That is a blatant lie and slander!</string>
  <string id="10952">Well... Contributions to the state on his behalf…</string>
  <string id="10953">Ah, you mean the bribes! Say it straight and stop mumbling! You need to bring him an amount that's going to look nice sitting in his safe. Small change won't do.</string>
  <string id="10954">will be fine.</string>
  <string id="10955">I found the folder.</string>
  <string id="14642">Ferguson was arrested and his terminal has been seized as part of the investigation. I can't send a request to the supply department for them to correct their mistake. I don't know where to find a soap supplier!</string>
  <string id="14643">I'll try to find a supplier.</string>
  <string id="14644">You can't buy that much soap in a store. I'm not sure you can buy anything there at all, actually. We need someone who can get their hands on anything.</string>
  <string id="6626">Sorry, I don't have time to talk to you right now!</string>
  <string id="6627">What a lovely day for work!</string>
  <string id="6629">-&gt;$6628</string>
  <string id="6631">Easy, fella! My name is Evan Redgrave. I'm new here, just started.</string>
  <string id="6632">Oh! I heard they hired some new guy. I'm Peter Dong. What do you want from me?</string>

  <string id="6654">Poor Hemnitz! I only met him yesterday, and now this... He seemed like a good guy.</string>
  <string id="6655">But he broke the law!</string>
  <string id="6656">So I heard...</string>
  <string id="6657">How could I not have seen him for the criminal he was? He outsmarted us all!</string>
  <string id="6659">-&gt;$6658</string>
  <string id="6660">He always seemed so polite, so neat... Never argued with anyone, went to all the meetings, voted the right way... Although now I see why he protected me from Legrand!</string>
  <string id="6662">-&gt;$6661</string>
  <string id="6663">He wanted to gain my trust and learn important secrets from me!</string>

  <string id="6683">Nothing to complain about! Except perhaps her perfume...</string>
  <string id="6684">What about her perfume?</string>
  <string id="6685">It's just this fragrance, Loving Leader No.3, it's so...</string>
  <string id="6686">Nasty?</string>
  <string id="6687">No, no, on the contrary! My mother loves it too... it's just... Oh, it doesn't matter.</string>
  <string id="6689">-&gt;$6688</string>
  <string id="6690">What do you think about the boss's secretary?</string>
  <string id="6691">To be honest, I envy her a bit!</string>
  <string id="6692">Envy? Why?</string>
  <string id="6693">The boss always keeps her close. That's real trust!</string>
  <string id="6694">Some people say she's mean!</string>
  <string id="6695">The ones who say that are worthless layabouts! Magda is a paragon of discipline, perseverance, and devotion! We should all be taking a leaf out of her book!</string>

  <string id="7590">What’s your deal with insects? They’re harmless.</string>
  <string id="7591">You wouldn’t say that if you’d been given a sleeping bag filled with b-b-bed bugs at the summer camp for the children of junior employees!</string>
  <string id="7592">Bedbugs are a fixture of Class J apartments, actually.</string>
  <string id="7593">And do you fight them with spiders in your Class J apartments?</string>
  <string id="7594">No, with repellent.</string>
  <string id="7595">Rep-p-pellent? Never had those in summer camps, they were considered an extravagance.</string>
  <string id="7596">Some professor even wrote an entire article on the consequences of using repellents.</string>
  <string id="7597">Like, there hadn’t been enough studies to show how they affect future generations’ health, and their chemical composition is, like, harmful to the environment.</string>
  <string id="7598">Sounds like an excuse for supply shortages.</string>
  <string id="7599">An excuse that meant they made us catch hobo spiders in the forest, stick them in our sleeping bags and wait for them to deal with the bedbugs.</string>
  <string id="7600">That’s horrible!</string>
  <string id="7601">You can say that again! I’ve hated all insects ever since.</string>
  <string id="7602">B-b-b-because he's a jerk and a b-b-b-bastard!</string>
  <string id="7603">I see.</string>
  <string id="7604">He knows I’m smarter, and it pisses him off. All he’s capable of is pulling stupid, often dangerous, pranks that he calls “harmless jokes”.</string>
  <string id="7605">Last time he stuck an experimental car safety airbag on my chair that b-b-b-bounced me up to the c-c-c-ceiling!</string>
  <string id="7607">-&gt;$7606</string>
  <string id="7608">A compression fracture of the spine is no joke! It’s dangerous! And he just laughed, “What could be safer than a safety airbag?!”</string>
  <string id="7609">B-b-b-because Legrand's daddy has m-m-m-money coming out of his ears, so his idiot son gets away with anything!</string>
  <string id="7610">While those who wanna w-w-work honestly can only rely on themselves! Doesn’t m-m-matter... Just you wait till I get that p-p-p-promotion!</string>
  <string id="7611">Legrand won’t be able to bully you anymore.</string>
  <string id="7612">This Legrand... I can’t bear to see his smirking face. I feel like one of these days I’ll just clobber him with something.</string>
  <string id="7613">So, you’re in love with Emma Hazer, aren’t you?</string>
  <string id="7614">What?!.. Me?!.. As if...</string>
  <string id="7615">Come on, Peter, I think she is a really nice girl, and you two would make a great couple!</string>
  <string id="7616">Do you really think so?</string>
  <string id="7617">-&gt;$8047</string>

  <string id="7619">-&gt;$9021</string>
  <string id="7620">No, Evan, you’re new here, you don’t get it... She laughed when Legrand pulled that nasty bubblegum prank. I had to shave all my hair off! She could never fall in love with me after that...</string>
  <string id="7621">How is it going with you and Emma?</string>
  <string id="7622">Thanks again, Evan! We’re so happy - words just can do it justice! She's stunning! She’s a miracle! I would gladly give my life for her!</string>
  <string id="7623">Don’t forget to invite me to the wedding!</string>
  <string id="7624">Certainly, Evan! You’ll be the guest of honor!</string>
  <string id="7625">Come to gloat, have you? She hates me, and it’s all because of you!</string>
  <string id="7629">She was an exemplary employee! I don’t understand...</string>
  <string id="7630">No, I only know what happened to him. Surely you know more - can you tell me anything? Everyone at the office is just d-d-dying to know the details!</string>
  <string id="7631">A shame... I heard that your father was a well-respected figure within the Ministry! Now I understand why you're stuck in this “waiting room” with the rest of us - you didn't get a chance to ride on his coattails, did you?</string>
  <string id="7632">Hey, you asked! So much for trying to have a heart-to-heart...</string>
  <string id="7633">-&gt;$6376</string>
  <string id="7636">Ask about family</string>
  <string id="7637">Do you have a big family?</string>
  <string id="7638">No, just me and my mom. My grandparents used to live with us, but when the Leader issued Directive No. 8989 “On Compact Living”, we sent them to the Euthanasia Center.</string>
  <string id="7639">And their room was given to a Ministry official.</string>
  <string id="7640">Didn’t you feel sorry for the old timers?</string>
  <string id="7641">Sorry or not, there was nothing to be done. Their time came, and order must be maintained!</string>
  <string id="7642">Ask about his mother</string>
  <string id="7643">I can tell you really love your mom.</string>
  <string id="7644">My mommy is a jewel! Since we took my grandparents to the Euthanasia Center, she’s been the only one who takes care of me. I don’t know what I would do without her! She makes killer scrambled eggs for breakfast!</string>
  <string id="7645">So you live together?</string>
  <string id="7646">Of course! Why would I waste m-m-m-money on a rented flat when I have my mom?</string>
  <string id="7647">But you’re nearly 30...</string>
  <string id="7648">Mommy says I’m not old enough to live alone. And I agree, I have to find my feet first!</string>
  <string id="7649">Ask about his father</string>
  <string id="7650">Was it your father who set you up in the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="7651">I did everything myself! And I don’t want to talk about that t-t-t-traitor! He betrayed the Leader, he b-b-b-betrayed the family, he b-b-b-betrayed the whole country!</string>
  <string id="7652">Oh my... What did he do? Steal something?</string>
  <string id="7653">If he had, he would have at least had something to bribe the police with. He just went around the workplace telling jokes about the Leader.</string>
  <string id="7654">How stupid do you have to be to do that? Thankfully, I have my mother’s smarts.</string>
  <string id="7655">Did he get fired?</string>
  <string id="7656">More like fired at. No one is allowed to laugh at the Great Leader! It’s for the best, really. The Wise Leader became my new father figure.</string>
  <string id="7658">-&gt;$7657</string>
  <string id="7659">Why are you still not married?</string>
  <string id="7660">Hey, that’s n-n-n-none of your business!</string>
  <string id="7661">Don’t get all riled up, I didn’t mean it in a bad way! It's just strange that a smart guy like you, with good prospects, hasn’t found someone yet.</string>
  <string id="7662">Mommy also says I’m quite a catch, but I guess I just haven’t met anyone worthy of being my partner yet.</string>
  <string id="7663">And the one I do want to be with won’t even look at me.</string>
  <string id="7664">Who’s that?</string>
  <string id="7665">D-d-d-doesn’t matter... I don’t want to waste my time on office drones in skirts, who only care about children and flowers!</string>
  <string id="7666">What qualities are you looking for?</string>
  <string id="7667">First and foremost she must be a patriot, like me, and secondly, she must be a woman.</string>
  <string id="7668">Mommy says so, and I agree!</string>
  <string id="7669">So how is it, working for the ministry?</string>
  <string id="7670">Ask about the boss</string>
  <string id="7671">What do you think about the boss? Is he strict?</string>
  <string id="7672">I avoid talking about the higher-ups and I advise you to do the same.</string>
  <string id="7673">Can you at least give me a couple of tips on how best to approach him?</string>
  <string id="7674">Tips? I’ve done everything by myself! Nobody ever helped me, and I won’t be helping anybody! Mom says you have to think for yourself!</string>
  <string id="7675">Ask about working conditions</string>
  <string id="7676">Is it always so loud, dark and stuffy in the general hall? How can anyone work in these conditions?</string>
  <string id="7677">Nobody’s keeping you here! Do you know how many people want a job at the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="7678">Can’t we at least open the windows?</string>
  <string id="7679">The Ministry forbids the opening of windows!</string>
  <string id="7680">Directive No. 9808, accident prevention. If your father had followed the law, he would still be alive!</string>
  <string id="7681">Leave my father out of it!</string>
  <string id="7682">Just saying, the law is the law! Even if we’re on the first floor - the windows must stay closed! Even if the air in here makes me see spots all the same - the windows must stay closed!</string>
  <string id="7683">Ask about promotion</string>
  <string id="7684">They say you’re the main candidate for promotion.</string>
  <string id="7685">Do you see anyone more worthy here?</string>
  <string id="7686">Don’t you?</string>
  <string id="7687">Listen, m-m-m-mister Redgrave! I will get this p-p-p-promotion no matter what, because I’m the best here!</string>
  <string id="7688">I’ve p-p-p-put many years of hard work into it and I won’t let anyone rob me of my h-h-hard-earned reward!</string>
  <string id="7689">-&gt;$9117</string>
  <string id="7691">-&gt;$7690</string>
  <string id="7692">Do you by any chance know anything about personal development seminars?</string>
  <string id="7693">No... although wait. A guy came to me recently with a leaflet about some seminar. I think there was something about personal development or some such nonsense.</string>
  <string id="7694">Did you keep the leaflet?</string>
  <string id="7695">No, why would I? I’m already a fully-developed person.</string>
  <string id="7696">Scoff at him</string>
  <string id="7697">With a head as big as yours it’s no wonder.</string>
  <string id="7698">Peter, I’ve found a great remedy for you!</string>
  <string id="7699">What does it do?</string>
  <string id="7700">Tell him they're headache pills</string>
  <string id="7701">Where did you run off to?</string>
  <string id="7702">The toilet, that’s where. Easy, Peter, breathe. Ugh!</string>
  <string id="7703">My head doesn’t hurt anymore after what happened. Something else does though! The shame!</string>
  <string id="7704">Evan, did you have anything to do with it?</string>
  <string id="7705">Of course not!</string>
  <string id="7706">I’m not sure I believe you.</string>
  <string id="7707">Peter, I wanted to talk about you and Hazer!</string>
  <string id="7708">There’s nothing there for me, you said so yourself. What else do you want?</string>
  <string id="7709">There is no “me and Hazer”. And it’s none of your business anyway!</string>
  <string id="7710">Use information from the terminal</string>
  <string id="7711">You can keep pretending, Peter, but I know for sure that you’re in love with her!</string>
  <string id="7712">-&gt;$13035</string>
  <string id="7713">Peter, I’ve seen my share of lovesick men. Trust me, the facial expression is unmistakeable! I looked that way myself when I was trying to woo my wife, so spill it!</string>
  <string id="7714">So everyone knows?! It can’t b-b-be true! Mommy will kill me...</string>
  <string id="7715">-&gt;$7476</string>
  <string id="7716">You’re right, Evan. I’m a worthless, pathetic nerd...</string>
  <string id="7717">I didn’t say anything like that!</string>
  <string id="7718">You don’t have to, I already know it! I fell in love with Emma like a fool the moment I set eyes on her, and I’ve suffered ever since.</string>
  <string id="7719">You know, we live in a country partial to suffering...</string>
  <string id="7720">There’s nothing to be ashamed of, she is a really nice girl. And I think you two would make a great couple!</string>
  <string id="7721">Have you seen how pretty she is? Like a cover girl from “Young patriots”! And me... I’m... How could I walk up to HER and..</string>
  <string id="7722">Help with Emma</string>
  <string id="7723">I won’t deny it, Peter, you’re not exactly the macho “bad boy” type all the girls love. But there are a lot of other positive qualities that women appreciate.</string>
  <string id="7724">You’re an all-round good guy, see? You just need to play to your strengths.</string>
  <string id="7725">W-w-what strengths?</string>
  <string id="7726">You’re hard-working, you don’t drink, you have prospects. And you don’t look at all like someone who could hurt a girl’s feelings.</string>
  <string id="7727">So what do I do? Where do I start?</string>
  <string id="7728">Ask her out on a date, but not to a restaurant or club, take her to the theater or an exhibition. It’ll show her how serious you are about her.</string>
  <string id="7729">A d-d-d-date? Are you n-n-n-nuts? She’ll just l-l-l-laugh at me!</string>
  <string id="7730">Then start with some flowers! Do you know what kind she likes?</string>
  <string id="7731">I accidentally found a page from a flower magazine in her trash can recently.</string>
  <string id="7732">It had red and white roses, violet violets, red poppies, yellow tulips and white feather grass on it.</string>
  <string id="7733">Some memory you have!</string>
  <string id="7734">You bet! Mommy says it’s phenomenal. I know all the Leader’s speeches by heart!</string>
  <string id="7735">You’d be better off remembering what kind of flowers the girl of your dreams likes! Okay, I'll try to find out myself.</string>
  <string id="7736">Oh, Evan, that would be wonderful!</string>
  <string id="7737">Don’t help with Emma</string>
  <string id="7738">You know what, I think you’re right. A pretty girl like her wouldn’t give you the time of day. Get over it, Peter.</string>
  <string id="7739">Have you found out what flowers Emma likes?</string>
  <string id="7740">Red roses</string>
  <string id="7741">I think red roses would be just right.</string>
  <string id="7742">White roses</string>
  <string id="7743">White roses would bring out the color of her eyes.</string>
  <string id="7744">Violet violets</string>
  <string id="7745">Violets will do nicely.</string>
  <string id="7746">Red poppies</string>
  <string id="7747">There’s nothing better than red poppies.</string>
  <string id="7748">Yellow tulips</string>
  <string id="7749">Flowers the color of the last morning star. Show everyone that the common stereotype about yellow tulips is wrong.</string>
  <string id="7750">White feather grass</string>
  <string id="7751">Show her you’re practical and modern. Feather grass is the perfect choice!</string>
  <string id="7752">I haven’t found out which she likes best yet.</string>
  <string id="7753">I hope it works.</string>
  <string id="7754">Did your bouquet impress Emma?</string>
  <string id="7755">I guess.</string>
  <string id="7756">Well, did she like the flowers?</string>
  <string id="7757">I think I screwed up...</string>
  <string id="7758">But did you give them to her?</string>
  <string id="7759">Yes, I put them on her desk in the morning, as planned. So what? She just laughed...</string>
  <string id="7760">Laughed or smiled?</string>
  <string id="7761">Well, smiled, but what difference does it make? It’s all over!</string>
  <string id="7762">Peter, you’re... a unique person. If she smiled, it means she liked them. Now ask her out!</string>
  <string id="7763">So, did you get around to asking Emma out?</string>
  <string id="7764">Are you c-c-c-crazy? I’ll never have enough n-n-n-nerve!</string>
  <string id="7765">Let me find you something to boost your confidence.</string>
  <string id="7766">Like what?</string>
  <string id="7767">I don’t know yet. We need to find you some good advice or ask around our colleagues. Leave it to me.</string>
  <string id="7768">-&gt;$15316</string>
  <string id="7769">What did you bring me?</string>

  <string id="7773">Give him whiskey</string>
  <string id="7775">There’s a first time for everything! Just don’t drink it on an empty stomach!</string>
  <string id="7776">Give him the brochure</string>
  <string id="7777">Here’s a brochure: “The 30 Best Conversation Starters”. It has a lot of tips to help you talk to anyone. Should come in handy.</string>
  <string id="7780">My head is pounding. I don’t remember what happened. And my cheek hurts.</string>
  <string id="7781">Hazer just gave you a massive slap in the face.</string>
  <string id="7782">Oh my Leader! It’s a disaster. I have no reason to live now. Maybe you can help me? You have to help me! After all, it was your idea for me to get drunk!</string>
  <string id="7783">I told you to eat first. Alright. I’ll try to talk to Emma.</string>
  <string id="7784">Did you talk to Emma? Is she angry? I want nothing more than to go on a date with her...</string>
  <string id="7785">Yes, I spoke with her. She’s not angry with you anymore. She agreed to talk, but only here, at the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="7786">Great! I have a plan on how to talk to Emma without making a fool of myself! Maybe I’ll even be able to ask her out!</string>
  <string id="7787">Not yet. I’ll tell you if I have any news.</string>

  <string id="7793">What? Oh, right... Well, when I see her, it’s like a white veil comes over my brain, and nothing comes to mind!</string>
  <string id="7794">So what? Will you just continue to devour her with your eyes and suffer all the while?</string>
  <string id="7795">I have a plan. But I’ll need your help.</string>
  <string id="7796">Are you ready to hear my plan now?</string>

  <string id="7801">I want you to feed me lines.</string>

  <string id="7803">I’ve thought it all through. I hacked into the security system ages ago and altered my access rights a little. When Emma leaves to go home, I’ll “run into” her in the waiting room.</string>
  <string id="7804">There’s plenty of screens there. You can connect to one of them and type up whatever I need to say.</string>
  <string id="7805">You hacked into the security system? What for?</string>
  <string id="7806">Er... it doesn’t matter now.</string>
  <string id="7807">Use your terminal to connect to the cameras and screens.</string>

  <string id="7821">Ask for help with promotion</string>
  <string id="7822">I hate to ask you this, but it's about career development...</string>
  <string id="7823">I was just talking about that with Emma. This race for promotion won’t lead to anything good for us. Working on different floors, so far away from each other...</string>

  <string id="9884">Er... Well... N-n-no.</string>
  <string id="9885">Well then, you can beat Legrand at his own game!</string>
  <string id="9886">What do you m-m-mean?</string>
  <string id="9887">I keep wondering how to prank Legrand.</string>

  <string id="9890">Me!</string>
  <string id="9891">What else?</string>
  <string id="9892">His job! He can’t stand it! This position at the Ministry is just wasted on him!</string>
  <string id="9893">And did you know that he’s only working here to get his father’s money?</string>
  <string id="9894">His father’s money! His father won’t give him any, and Marco himself is so bad at his job... Now I know how to get my own back!</string>

  <string id="9896">I’m afraid nothing comes to mind.</string>
  <string id="9897">No ideas here either...</string>
  <string id="9898">Peter, was it you who did that to Legrand?</string>

  <string id="9900">Oh my god! Did you kill his father?</string>
  <string id="9901">Are you n-n-nuts?! I’ve just faked a letter from his father’s lawyer, t-t-telling Legrand that all the m-m-money now belongs to him.</string>
  <string id="9902">How did you manage that?</string>

  <string id="9917">I know, right? I haven’t missed a single episode!</string>
  <string id="9918">I just don’t get it why it’s called The Patriot “Adventures”, when all they do is sit around and talk about who's the best patriot. What about the adventure part?</string>
  <string id="9919">That’s just the beginning! Then they all get arrested and it gets really good! Keep watching!</string>
  <string id="9920">Oh, now I see!</string>
  <string id="9921">Peter, I watched an episode of The Patriot Adventures where all the patriots were sent to jail and tortured. But they hadn’t done anything wrong!</string>
  <string id="9922">Well of course not, Evan! If they’d actually done anything wrong, they would have been executed instead!</string>
  <string id="9923">But they were arrested by their own people!</string>
  <string id="9924">What kind of patriots would they be if they’d been captured by the Boreans? That would make it The Traitor Adventures!</string>
  <string id="9925">Oh, now I get it.</string>
  <string id="9926">The season finale of The Patriot Adventures was just... wow. My eyes were glued to the screen!</string>
  <string id="9927">Yeah! I was almost in tears when they started clubbing Alex Naval between the legs with a crowbar!</string>
  <string id="9928">And when they were all stuffed into the latrine pit? Amazing stuff!</string>
  <string id="9929">I think next season will be even cooler! Are you going to watch it?</string>
  <string id="9930">Like you need to ask! I’ve already marked the date on my calendar!</string>

  <string id="9941">Someone advised her t-t-to invest in Horns &amp; Hoofs. You know, that company that sells different kinds of jellied m-m-meat with names like “Patriotic”, “Ministerial”... It tastes vile!</string>
  <string id="9942">They promised her huge returns... M-m-mom invested her savings, borrowed from relatives and neighbors - she even took out a loan!</string>
  <string id="9943">So what happened?</string>
  <string id="9944">They went broke! The investors stormed their office, but the owners and the money vanished into thin air!</string>

  <string id="9950">Promise to help</string>

  <string id="9956">Don’t say that, Peter, I was being sincere!</string>
  <string id="9957">And what good is your sincerity to me? Will it pay our d-d-debt? Or chase off the creditors? Ha! No, I’ll have to have a m-m-man-to-man talk with these jerks, like the m-m-manly man I am! I’ll m-m-make them squirm!</string>

  <string id="9968">I have an idea, but I’m worried you won’t be able to pull it off...</string>
  <string id="9969">I’ll do anything for mommy! Tell me!</string>
  <string id="9970">I heard that Ferguson has a nice fat bundle of Patriotic Loan bonds in his office safe. If you can find a buyer for them, you’ll make good money!</string>
  <string id="9971">Do you reckon Ferguson would share them with us?</string>
  <string id="9972">Are you an idiot, Peter? Of course not. You have to take them from him.</string>
  <string id="9973">Me? I won’t be able to pull that off!</string>
  <string id="9974">That’s what I said in the first place...</string>
  <string id="9975">No! I can do it! For mommy! For happiness! For life!</string>

  <string id="9983">Sell a kidney? Is that safe?</string>
  <string id="9984">Absolutely. Those guys are professionals - you won’t even notice it’s gone! No health certificates, tests or other hurdles. Cash in hand right after the surgery.</string>
  <string id="9985">But why the slums? It’s unhygienic...</string>

  <string id="10012">I knew you’d help m-m-mommy, Evan!</string>
  <string id="10013">Sorry, Peter, even that won't protect whoever breaks into Ferguson’s safe from a little police brutality.</string>
  <string id="10014">But what am I to do? I’ll have to sell our Class B apartment residence permit.</string>
  <string id="10015">These bonds are my only hope, Evan! I’m desperate. How much longer do you need?</string>
  <string id="10016">It’s not that simple, Peter. You’ll have to wait a bit more.</string>
  <string id="10017">Give him the bonds</string>
  <string id="10018">Here you go. If you can find the right buyer, you’ll get good money for this wad!</string>
  <string id="10019">Oh Evan! You’ve saved us both!</string>
  <string id="10020">Good luck, Peter! To you and your mommy.</string>
  <string id="10021">You’re a g-g-good person, Evan Redgrave! I p-p-promised to give you all my Authority, and I’ll do just that!</string>
  <string id="10023">Seems that my intel was wrong. There was nothing of value in the safe. I’m sorry, Peter.</string>
  <string id="10024">Oh no! What am I to d-d-do?</string>
  <string id="10025">Here I am. Did you want something? You don’t look that great, by the way, a little green around the gills...</string>
  <string id="10026">It’s nothing, Evan! More importantly, my mother is safe now!</string>
  <string id="10027">Did you get the money?</string>
  <string id="10028">Yes, I w-went to the Share Your Heart headquarters and they c-c-cut out my kid-kid-kid-kidney!</string>
  <string id="10029">They cut out your kid? Didn’t know you were pregnant!</string>
  <string id="10030">Oh, ha ha... Very funny, Evan.</string>
  <string id="10031">Don’t take it to... heart. So you sold your kidney. And?</string>
  <string id="10032">And now mommy and I have enough money to pay off our debt, and even a little to spare! Thank you again, Evan!</string>
  <string id="10033">I told mom about those people buying kidneys on the domestic market. She said that she’d go, though I tried to talk her out of it.</string>
  <string id="10034">She had a kidney removed, Evan. And the doctor said there was a tumor in it - they got it out just in time! So not only did they pay her for the kidney, they saved her life too!</string>
  <string id="10035">I guess they’ll still transplant it. Why waste a kidney, after all. Thanks again, Evan!</string>

  <string id="6742">Hello.</string>
  <string id="6743">Hello! Why haven't I seen you before?</string>
  <string id="6744">I'm new here. My name is Evan.</string>
  <string id="6745">Emma Hazer, nice to meet you.</string>
  <string id="6746">Suggest undressing Dong in the toilet</string>
  <string id="6748">-&gt;$6747</string>

  <string id="6759">-&gt;$6652</string>
  <string id="6761">-&gt;$6760</string>
  <string id="6762">I can't talk about that, sorry.</string>
  <string id="6763">Continue questioning 50</string>
  <string id="6764">George helped me out on my first day.</string>
  <string id="6765">I was just so surprised, he seemed like such a nice guy...</string>
  <string id="6766">And now he's gone for good... Nice guys don't have it easy these days. Nice guys like George even more so!</string>
  <string id="6767">-&gt;$6661</string>
  <string id="6768">He was too damn nice. Loved his wife and kids, helped everyone. Lent people money till payday. Didn't meddle, didn't scheme. He knew how to listen. Made you feel at ease, you know?</string>
  <string id="6769">-&gt;$8887</string>
  <string id="6770">Why would you, you're a man. But women can sense that. He was just... good. I don't know how to explain it.</string>
  <string id="6771">What did you want to know about him?</string>
  <string id="6772">Did he ever get into any trouble at the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="6773">Trouble? He was always the perfect employee - they held him up as an example for the rest of us!</string>
  <string id="6774">Did he have any enemies at work?</string>
  <string id="6775">It's surprising for our little vipers' nest, but no. George managed to stay friends with everyone. Even with Legrand - and he's a complete asshole!</string>
  <string id="6776">What was he punished for?</string>
  <string id="6777">I don't fully understand. Or rather, I do - you heard it all yourself. But I don't believe it.</string>
  <string id="6778">But the Ministry is never wrong... I guess I'm a bad judge of character.</string>
  <string id="6780">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="6781">It doesn't concern me. He helped everyone.</string>
  <string id="6782">-&gt;$6376</string>
  <string id="6783">Emma, aren't your family worried about you working so much?</string>
  <string id="6784">Oh please... What kind of family can you have when you're working for the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="6785">Hemnitz had one...</string>
  <string id="6786">Well, Hemnitz is more of an exception. I'm not in a hurry to get married!</string>
  <string id="6787">-&gt;$7606</string>
  <string id="6788">Now don't you laugh! I'm looking for a worthy candidate and I'm not going to throw myself at the first man I meet!</string>
  <string id="6789">What about kids?</string>
  <string id="6790">Who told you- Oh. I mean, what about them?</string>
  <string id="6791">Don't you want kids?</string>
  <string id="6792">With my salary? With my hours? I'm afraid I'd make a bad mother... turns out I did...</string>
  <string id="6793">-&gt;$5706</string>
  <string id="6794">It's nothing, just thinking aloud. Let's not talk about this.</string>
  <string id="6795">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="6797">-&gt;$6796</string>
  <string id="6798">So how is it, working for the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="6799">I've only been working here for half a year. I prepare documents, write reports, collect statistics...</string>
  <string id="6800">-&gt;$9460</string>
  <string id="6801">...edit orders, file correspondence, issue travel allowances, send packages, receive packages, distribute packages...</string>
  <string id="6802">Emma, I get it!</string>
  <string id="6803">...And that's not to mention the visitors. They just won't stop coming. And I do some other stuff.</string>
  <string id="6804">-&gt;$8003</string>
  <string id="6805">What can I do, I need the money! To be honest, by the end of the day I'm ready to collapse... Maybe I can find a husband here and finally give up this grind.</string>
  <string id="6806">-&gt;$7091</string>
  <string id="6807">Emma, are you alright?</string>
  <string id="6809">Fine, I'm just exhausted. Had to do some reports at home.</string>
  <string id="6810">What hurts most is that Magda just threw them onto the pile without even opening them. Either she trusts me, or they don't matter... Well, at least I get paid for them.</string>
  <string id="6815">Ask about Peter Dong</string>
  <string id="6816">Emma, what do you think about Peter Dong?</string>
  <string id="6820">But he's smart and a hard worker. He has a bright future ahead of him.</string>
  <string id="6822">Listen, I have a great idea, but I need your help!</string>
  <string id="6823">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="6824">Let's make Peter Dong run through the office - pantless. Wouldn't that be a laugh!</string>
  <string id="6825">What does that have to do with me?</string>
  <string id="6826">You could lure him into the toilet and pull it off. The prank, I mean. He'll follow you in there like a lamb to the slaughter!</string>
  <string id="6832">Nobody's a match for the Leader, he's one of a kind!</string>
  <string id="6833">-&gt;$8183</string>
  <string id="6835">You think so? An interesting thought... Alright, I'll try!</string>
  <string id="6837">Emma, I know the idea doesn't sound great. But it's very important to me. This prank is a way to come to an agreement with Legrand.</string>
  <string id="6838">Okay, I'll help you. But a friendship with Legrand will do you no good.</string>
  <string id="6839">Sounds unconvincing.</string>
  <string id="6841">I'm ready to pay to see a pantless Peter!</string>
  <string id="6842">I see you and Legrand are birds of a feather! Alright, the prank isn't that bad.</string>
  <string id="6843">I'll help when you have money.</string>
  <string id="6845">Have a nice day.</string>
  <string id="7098">I’ve only started recently, so it’s a bit hard to follow the plot, but it looks interesting!</string>
  <string id="7099">Oh wow, that’s great news! At least now I’m not the only one watching it - I never have anyone to discuss episodes with...</string>
  <string id="7100">What do you think of Leôncio? A bit too goody-goody for my taste. But there’s no denying he loves Nicole to death.</string>
  <string id="7101">I wonder if this kind of love can exist in real life. Like Brad’s, when Catherine fell into a coma after falling down the stairs at the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="7102">By the way, what do you think about Mark and Marcie?</string>
  <string id="7106">-&gt;$6277</string>
  <string id="7107">Mark is a controversial character. I think he’s just pretending to be madly in love with Stephanie so he can get a promotion.</string>
  <string id="7108">But in fact, he has love only for his Motherland and the Leader. And for himself, a bit.</string>
  <string id="7109">And Marcie is the cutest doggy I’ve ever seen!</string>
  <string id="7110">You’re sweet, Evan Redgrave!</string>
  <string id="7111">-&gt;$6705</string>
  <string id="7115">Hi Emma, how are you?</string>
  <string id="7131">-&gt;$7585</string>
  <string id="7134">-&gt;$11441</string>
  <string id="7135">Flirt</string>
  <string id="7137">Talk about medical bills</string>
  <string id="7139">Talk about flowers</string>
  <string id="7145">-&gt;$6337</string>
  <string id="7146">-&gt;$14798</string>
  <string id="7147">Emma, why do you hide that you have kids?</string>
  <string id="7150">My husband died in the war when I was pregnant with our second.</string>
  <string id="7151">I left them at the farm with some relatives and came here as a way to support them. Once I save up enough money, I’ll move them to the city...</string>
  <string id="7152">But please don’t tell anyone about this, or I’ll never get a promotion!</string>
  <string id="7153">Talk about money</string>
  <string id="7154">Are happy with your salary?</string>
  <string id="7155">Stupid question! Are you?</string>
  <string id="7156">Weeell...</string>
  <string id="7157">Same “weeell” for me. I slave away, but I get paid peanuts. I have to ask Magda Rakovich for extra work just to make ends meet.</string>
  <string id="7158">Talk about personal life</string>
  <string id="7159">You know what surprises me? You're young, beautiful, and smart! How come you have problems with men?</string>
  <string id="7160">They’re the ones who have problems with me, haha!</string>
  <string id="7161">No, but seriously.</string>
  <string id="7162">Why do you care? Yes, I’m young, beautiful, and smart, but no one has asked me to marry them.</string>
  <string id="7163">Only looking for a husband, then?</string>
  <string id="7164">You know, I may be young, but I’m not a teenager sleeping around for fun. I want to marry a person I love, and quit this job to take care of my children and home.</string>
  <string id="7165">A normal enough wish, don’t you think?</string>
  <string id="7167">-&gt;$9932</string>
  <string id="7169">You know, I prefer not to talk about them.</string>
  <string id="7170">Who wants a single mother with two kids? Besides, you know the directive on increasing the birth rate: a woman with two children must stay at home. Even if she starves to death as a result!</string>
  <string id="7171">Emma, I won’t tell anyone, I swear!</string>
  <string id="7172">Alright, then... I have two lovely babies: Tommy, the eldest, and my little angel Anry. They’re the image of their father. It is a pity they’ll never see him again...</string>
  <string id="7173">Everything I do here is for them. I’d wade through oceans of mud for my children without batting an eye.</string>
  <string id="7174">Why do you ask?</string>
  <string id="7175">He likes you, doesn’t he?</string>
  <string id="7176">As if I didn't know! But Peter's a small fish in a big pond, if you know what I mean.</string>
  <string id="7178">Not exactly a dream come true, of course, but he’s quite a decent guy!</string>
  <string id="7179">They say if you want to be a general’s wife, you have to marry a lieutenant. Take him before someone else does!</string>
  <string id="7180">You can change him however you like, support him, and he’ll be up for promotion before you know it.</string>
  <string id="7183">Sounds awful.</string>
  <string id="7184">It’s none of my business.</string>
  <string id="7185">I think so too, handsome.</string>
  <string id="7186">Talk about flowers</string>
  <string id="7187">What kind of flowers do you like?</string>
  <string id="7188">All kinds. Except poppies, I’m allergic to them.</string>
  <string id="7189">Talk about colors</string>
  <string id="7190">What’s your favorite color?</string>
  <string id="7191">Red, of course. Everyone loves red. It’s bright like the Ministry’s banners.</string>
  <string id="7192">Any plans for tonight?</string>
  <string id="7193">The usual - finish some paperwork, watch TV and go to bed.</string>
  <string id="7194">Does a pretty girl like you really have nothing more fun to do after work? Is it really just more work and TV?</string>
  <string id="7195">This pretty girl would love to do something fun if the company is good. Any suggestions?</string>
  <string id="7196">Invite into the storeroom</string>
  <string id="7197">I don’t know about after work, but as for now...</string>
  <string id="7199">-&gt;$7198</string>
  <string id="7200">I’m still new to this city. I’m all alone. I have no one. No one to hold me, to keep me warm...</string>
  <string id="7201">What are you getting at? Ooooh! What’s this?</string>
  <string id="7202">Pop into the storeroom with me and I’ll show you.</string>
  <string id="7203">You’re a cocky one, Redgrave! I thought you were married?</string>
  <string id="7204">What makes you think I’d go in there with you?</string>
  <string id="7205">Forget about it.</string>
  <string id="7206">We’re adults, we’re free to do what we like, so why not? Besides...</string>
  <string id="7207">Lie about feelings</string>
  <string id="7208">Emma, I can’t bear it anymore! I’ve been thinking about you ever since I first laid eyes on you... I can’t get you out of my head...</string>
  <string id="7209">So what? You’re married!</string>
  <string id="7210">How could I have known when I got married that I’d meet you?! One kiss in private is all I’m asking for!</string>
  <string id="7211">-&gt;$15009</string>
  <string id="7212">I give you my word! One kiss, that’s all!</string>
  <string id="7213">Wow! That’s so romantic! Just like in my favorite TV show, when Kurt dumped Stephanie for Sophia!</string>
  <string id="7214">Alright, let’s do this... And if I like it, then what? And wipe that smug grin off your face!</string>
  <string id="7215">I’ll be waiting for you there!</string>
  <string id="7216">Offer money</string>
  <string id="7217">I heard you need money? I can give it to you!</string>
  <string id="7218">Would you look at that, now he’s suddenly rich!</string>
  <string id="7219">Offer</string>
  <string id="7221"> that could be yours!</string>
  <string id="7222">What do you take me for?</string>
  <string id="7226">Yeah-yeah, I can see you’re well-endowed... with humor, now please put it away.</string>
  <string id="7229">? Think about it!</string>
  <string id="7230">Do you really have that kind of money?</string>
  <string id="7231">Here, look.</string>
  <string id="7233">Damn you, give me the money and go wait.</string>
  <string id="7235">-&gt;$7234</string>
  <string id="7236">Are you an idiot? Do you want the whole office to see us going into the storeroom together? Move it! I'll follow you soon.</string>
  <string id="7237">I don’t have that kind of money! I mean, um, not on me right now. Maybe later.</string>
  <string id="7238">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="7239">Emma, it was just a bad joke!</string>
  <string id="7240">I didn’t expect something like that from you, Evan! You seemed like a good guy!</string>
  <string id="7241">Emma, we need to talk. When did you last see a doctor?</string>
  <string id="7242">-&gt;$13147</string>
  <string id="7243">I seem to be having some... after-effects.</string>
  <string id="7244">-&gt;$7476</string>
  <string id="7245">It looks like an STD. They taught us how to recognize the symptoms in the army.</string>
  <string id="7246">What?! And you think I gave it to you?! How could you even think that!</string>
  <string id="7247">What else am I supposed to think?</string>
  <string id="7248">Anything but that! Wait a second... Does this mean I’m infected now too?! You pig! You piece of shit!</string>
  <string id="7254">You’ve been spending too much time with Legrand! Dong is harmless. Why would I do that?</string>
  <string id="7255">Blackmail with kids</string>
  <string id="7256">Well, I’m sorry then.</string>
  <string id="7257">What are you sorry for?</string>
  <string id="7258">I’m sorry that the Ministry is going to find out about your kids...</string>
  <string id="7259">What? You wouldn’t dare!</string>
  <string id="7260">I wouldn’t, but Legrand might just let it slip. He doesn’t care who he gets to laugh at. So choose. It’s either you, or Dong.</string>
  <string id="7261">Damn that Legrand! If it weren’t for that promotion... Alright, I’m in!</string>
  <string id="7264">I don’t have money, Evan, you know that. Otherwise, I wouldn’t say no to a pill - I’m up to my neck in work!</string>
  <string id="7265">I'd give you some for free in celebration of a successful prank!</string>
  <string id="7266">For free? Well, when you put it like that... Dong has already been through a lot... One more embarrassment won’t kill him!</string>
  <string id="7267">Hi Emma! Can you help me?</string>
  <string id="7268">I don’t have any money. Apart from that - sure, I’ll do anything for you!</string>
  <string id="7269">I was given a bribe! I didn’t even see when, I just saw the envelope on the desk. What should I do?</string>
  <string id="7270">-&gt;$6537</string>
  <string id="7271">But it’s a bribe!</string>
  <string id="7272">Evan, darling, you’re so naive! If you don’t take bribes, how do you expect to meet the quota?</string>
  <string id="7273">With honest work and perseverance!</string>
  <string id="7274">I mean the Bribe Quota! Didn’t they tell you your target percentage?</string>
  <string id="7275">Target percentage?! Emma, this is a crime!</string>
  <string id="7276">It’ll be a crime if you don’t give your boss his share. I give my 70% fair and square, and that’s reasonable... some want more!</string>
  <string id="7277">I see...</string>
  <string id="7278">Oh, and a piece of advice: don't even think about hiding it. There are eyes everywhere, you know.</string>
  <string id="7282">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="7285">You look tired, are you alright?</string>
  <string id="7286">All this work is driving me crazy! I’m completely exhausted!</string>
  <string id="7287">Some of my friends recommended a kind of remedy... they say it helps in situations like this.</string>
  <string id="7289">I'm no expert... but it’s something like an energy stimulant. Opens up the internal reserves, lifts your mood, gives you strength...</string>
  <string id="7290">What’s it called? Where can I buy it?</string>
  <string id="7291">Well... you won’t find it in a pharmacy. But I have some left I can share...</string>
  <string id="7292">-&gt;$8020</string>
  <string id="7293">Tell her it’s a drug</string>
  <string id="7294">It’s sort of a light drug. I was given it in the strictest confidence... I hope you won’t give me up, will you?</string>
  <string id="7295">-&gt;$8006</string>
  <string id="7296">So, do you want to try it?</string>
  <string id="7297">You know, I have two kids, the last thing I need is to start messing around with drugs! No thanks!</string>
  <string id="7298">Persuade 500</string>
  <string id="7299">Well, it’s a light drug, so it’s not completely legal, but you know how it is - a lot of things are banned, even green apples!</string>
  <string id="7300">It’s not the same!</string>
  <string id="7301">Alcohol is also a light drug, but you still drink it. And it makes you throw up, gives you hangovers and leaves a bad taste in your mouth...</string>
  <string id="7302">This gives you energy, puts you in a good mood... you’ll feel like you can move mountains! Why am I trying to convince you? If you don’t want it, suit yourself. I’ll use it.</string>
  <string id="7303">Wait! Just one dose won't hurt, right? And I need to finish this report by evening no matter what... Give me this stimulant of yours!</string>
  <string id="7305">No, I’m not interested.</string>
  <string id="7306">You wanted to talk?</string>
  <string id="7310">I need your pills!</string>
  <string id="7311">Sell for 500</string>
  <string id="7316">Give for free</string>
  <string id="7317">Again? Here you go. Buried under more paperwork?</string>
  <string id="7318">Like you wouldn’t believe, Evan! Tons of work, no money - I'm at my wits' end! These wonder-pills are my only hope!</string>
  <string id="7319">Refuse</string>
  <string id="7320">Emma, I think you should slow down.</string>
  <string id="7321">But I know you have them!</string>
  <string id="7322">Emma, shush, you’re getting too excited! You do remember it’s a drug, don’t you?</string>
  <string id="7323">Says the dealer to the addict, haha! To hell with you, then. I’ll go to Legrand, I heard he can get some stuff too.</string>
  <string id="7324">Talk her out of it</string>
  <string id="7327">Don't tell me how to live my life! I could do with some real help!</string>
  <string id="7330">Agree to sell drugs</string>
  <string id="7331">Well, it’s up to you...</string>
  <string id="7332">Give them to me, quick!</string>
  <string id="7334">Here you go! You’re my savior!</string>
  <string id="7335">Keep going</string>
  <string id="7336">Do you have more pills?</string>
  <string id="7341">How much?! That’s insane, who’d pay that kind of price for them?</string>

  <string id="7349">Thanks! It’s a nightmare. I’m always late! I can't seem to do anything right - your pills are the only thing that can save me. Sorry, I know they cost money...</string>

  <string id="7361">Emma, I'm begging you, be quiet!</string>
  <string id="7362">I. Need. Pills. Give them to me, or I swear I’ll take them by force.</string>
  <string id="7363">I’d like to see you try...</string>
  <string id="7364">Alright, you bastard, you’ve brought this on yourself...</string>
  <string id="7369">Sell for 3000</string>
  <string id="7375">Fine, I was saving this for my youngest, but if he’s lived without the operation this long, he can wait a bit longer... Here! Now give me the pills!</string>
  <string id="7376">Here you go, but it’s the last time. I’m worried about you, Emma.</string>

  <string id="8406">But these are my children, even if they are living with my parents right now. Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="8407">They’ll be better off in a foster home than with your parents. And they won't starve there, either. In our country, children come first!</string>
  <string id="8408">Sounds too good to be true. But I don’t know any foster homes. Listen, Evan, if you find something, let me know, okay?</string>
  <string id="8409">Okay, Emma.</string>
  <string id="8415">-&gt;$8996</string>
  <string id="8416">-&gt;$14701</string>
  <string id="8417">Evan, have you found me any candidates?</string>
  <string id="8418">Send her to Legrand's father</string>
  <string id="8419">Emma, I recently talked to Legrand, and I've got a great idea.</string>
  <string id="8420">No, not Legrand! I'd rather marry a frog than that jerk!</string>
  <string id="8421">Wait, let me finish. Legrand has a rich father who wants his son to have a family. I called him and gave him a very flattering description of you, and now he wants to meet you himself.</string>
  <string id="8423">The plan is simple: go to his father's house and use all your womanly charms to seduce him. Then he’ll marry you! Go for the father, not the son! His name is Henry Legrand, by the way.</string>
  <string id="8424">I don't know. Are you sure about this, Evan?</string>
  <string id="8425">Yes, it's a great plan! The old man wants to hear the “pitter-patter of children's feet” at home. And most importantly, you won't have to worry about money.</string>
  <string id="8426">Okay, thanks Evan. I'll try!</string>
  <string id="8427">No, I'm not sure. Let me think about it some more, Emma.</string>
  <string id="8428">Tell her about the advertisement</string>
  <string id="8429">Emma I found an interesting ad. Some young man is in search of a girlfriend. Judging by the ad, he’s pretty well-off.</string>
  <string id="8430">Oh, that's wonderful. Are you sure this ad can be trusted?</string>
  <string id="8431">I think so, yes. Get yourself ready for a date - here's the number.</string>
  <string id="8432">Thanks, Evan, you're a true friend!</string>
  <string id="8436">He's a bit bald... But the main thing is that he's a good person. And I think he's already in love with me! He said that me and the children can move in to his place.</string>
  <string id="8437">He was so happy when he found out that I already have children!</string>
  <string id="8438">That’s wonderful news!</string>
  <string id="8444">That's good news!</string>
  <string id="8446">I'm glad to hear it, Emma. Call me when you get settled there.</string>
  <string id="8447">Of course, Evan. Thank you!</string>
  <string id="8448">Evan, have you found an orphanage for my kids?</string>
  <string id="8449">The Young Guard patriotic camp</string>
  <string id="8450">Recently I ran into a group of children and their counselor - they were from some new patriotic camp. As far as I understand, they’re recruiting children, and I think you can send your children there.</string>
  <string id="8451">A patriotic camp? Do you think my children would be better off there?</string>
  <string id="8452">I think they’d like it much better than living with your parents - who can't stand them.</string>
  <string id="8453">Thank you, Evan. You’ve helped me a lot. I'll send the children to this camp. I hope they'll let me see them from time to time.</string>
  <string id="8454">Cornflower orphanage</string>
  <string id="8455">I heard about a place called the Cornflower orphanage. It seems like the conditions there are pretty great.</string>
  <string id="8456">Are you sure, Evan? Is it really such a good place?</string>
  <string id="8457">Yes. Your children will feel better in the orphanage, and you’ll be able to visit them any time you like.</string>
  <string id="8458">Thanks, Evan, I don't know what I'd do without you. I'll call them as soon as possible.</string>
  <string id="8459">Hi, Emma! Did you call the orphanage?</string>
  <string id="8460">Yes, I called them. They don't have any places. I don't know what to do.</string>
  <string id="8461">Let me think. Well, you can…</string>
  <string id="8462">Use you looks</string>
  <string id="8463">Emma, you're a beautiful woman, try using that. Go on a date with the director. But I don't have to tell you what to do, do I? Take matters into your own hands and you’ll succeed.</string>
  <string id="8464">Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="8465">Absolutely! Put on a sexy dress and get a move on! And who knows, maybe you won't jut find something for your children, but someone for yourself as well.</string>
  <string id="8466">Fine, I'll give it a go.</string>
  <string id="8467">I’ll handle it.</string>
  <string id="8468">Okay, give me the number. I'll call them and come up with something.</string>
  <string id="8469">Yes, I'm sure. I'll let you know how it goes.</string>
  <string id="8470">Thank you so much! I don't know how to thank you!</string>
  <string id="8471">Hi! How are the children doing?</string>
  <string id="8472">I don't know, nobody tells me much. They only say that I shouldn't worry and that my children are in safe hands. I hope they’re doing well.</string>
  <string id="8473">I'm sure everything’s okay!</string>
  <string id="8474">Thank you for your help.</string>
  <string id="8475">So? Did you manage to get your kids into the orphanage?</string>
  <string id="8476">I did. Although I had to spend the night with their director, and then blackmail him. But he agreed in the end, so it all ended well.</string>
  <string id="8477">Sex and blackmail? You’re full of surprises, Emma.</string>
  <string id="8478">You were the one who told me to take matters into my own hands. Whatever, it doesn't matter anymore. Thank you for your help.</string>
  <string id="8479">Hi Emma! I’ve settled everything with the orphanage. They’re waiting for your children.</string>
  <string id="8480">Thank you so much, Evan! Here, take this. For all your help.</string>
  <string id="8497">If you keep watching it, we can become TV buddies!</string>
  <string id="8498">Evan, did you see yesterday's episode?</string>
  <string id="8499">Yes, and I have a question. How can Brad love Catherine more than his homeland?</string>
  <string id="8500">It was in a recent episode. It turns out that Brad is a spy for Valverde, and came to the country to kill the Leader. But then he met Catherine and forgot all about his mission!</string>
  <string id="8501">Ah, I see! It’s a pity I haven’t seen those older episodes.</string>
  <string id="8502">Don’t worry! Once a year, they show a non-stop, 24-hour long recap of all the previous episodes. Doesn’t that sound like heaven?!</string>
  <string id="8503">Wow, what a surprise twist! I wonder what’s going to happen next?</string>
  <string id="8504">Don't worry, Evan, it's just that the characters’ storyline has ended. They’ll introduce some new ones, and everything will be just like it was before: scandal, intrigue, investigations, love! But the Leader will always come to the rescue.</string>
  <string id="8505">I see. That's great!</string>
  <string id="8506">Evan, thank you for these little chats. I feel like we've become friends.</string>

  <string id="8510">I talked to him recently.</string>
  <string id="8511">Turns out he can be pretty interesting.</string>
  <string id="8512">He was dead drunk, couldn't string two words together!</string>
  <string id="8513">Someone sent me flowers recently. I'm sure it was him.</string>
  <string id="8514">Red roses - my favorite.</string>
  <string id="8515">A pity these aren’t my favorite flowers.</string>
  <string id="8516">Nothing. He's just a colleague.</string>
  <string id="8517">You really think so? Well, he's sweet. And he gave me flowers.</string>
  <string id="8518">Red roses are my favorite. There’s a lot I can forgive if someone gives me them.</string>
  <string id="8519">But is it really that hard to find out what flowers a girl likes before sending them to her?</string>
  <string id="8520">He recently came up to me... Wanted to say something. But he was drunk as a pirate - couldn't string two words together!</string>
  <string id="8521">Persuade her to give him a chance</string>
  <string id="8522">There is something to what you’re saying... I'll take a closer look at him. Tell him to come see me sometime - we can take a walk along the corridors of the Ministry.</string>

  <string id="8539">That only happens in the movies! Besides, no one in our office can compare to the Leader...</string>
  <string id="8540">All hail the Leader! So I’m saying, maybe there’s someone worthy here, but he just hasn’t noticed you yet? What if this is your chance?</string>
  <string id="8541">We've talked about this show before, but clearly you don't love it as much as I do!</string>

  <string id="9799">Do you have children?</string>
  <string id="9800">Yeah, two boys...</string>
  <string id="9801">Maybe I'll find a place for my children. I'm not a good mother.</string>

  <string id="9803">I don't know. Maybe I'll find a place for my children... or find a husband and have a big happy family...</string>
  <string id="9804">After Dong's death, I finally realized how lonely I am. Can you give me any advice, Evan?</string>
  <string id="9805">I like your idea of looking for a husband. If he's rich, he can support you and your children.</string>
  <string id="9806">But it has to be someone outside the Ministry! I still have nightmares after Dong's arrest.</string>
  <string id="9807">I’m still eyeing up our colleagues, but I wouldn’t bet on that option. You’re married, and the rest aren't exactly Prince Charming.</string>

  <string id="9810">No, I quit.</string>
  <string id="9811">What?! When?</string>
  <string id="9812">Right now. You advised me to go on a date, Evan, and it was great! Henry is a very nice and kind man. It's hard to believe that Marco is his son.</string>
  <string id="9813">And you'll have one less competitor to deal with.</string>
  <string id="9814">I went on a blind date like you said, and I met someone. So I decided to quit!</string>

  <string id="9816">Yeah, I’m going to see him tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="9817">Are you an idiot? Peter shot people at the checkpoint!</string>
  <string id="9818">You talked me into pranking him - and what’s the end result? He's dead! Other people are dead!</string>
  <string id="9819">Evan, I swear on the Leader that he didn’t do it because of me! It can’t be because of me, right? He just had a lot of problems, and really the person to blame is...</string>
  <string id="9820">Not me! It was his choice. I still have to sort out my personal life...</string>
  <string id="9821">You want to say: “What did I think of him?”.</string>
  <string id="9822">My life had just started to get better... What bad luck!</string>
  <string id="9823">He was too proper and too good. I can't believe it was all a mask - that he was really a criminal.</string>
  <string id="9824">We’re dating. I hope it’ll work out.</string>

  <string id="6995">Ask about Peter Dong</string>
  <string id="6996">Do you know Peter Dong?</string>
  <string id="7402">Fella in glasses, likes cabbage pies, but always says his mom makes ‘em better.</string>
  <string id="6998">Anything else?</string>
  <string id="6999">He once bought a raisin roll, but instead of raisins inside, there were bits of cockroach. These things happen. The poor fellow got so sick that the guards came running. Thought it was a terrorist attack!</string>
  <string id="7000">Turns out he's been afraid of insects since childhood. What a prima donna! I've heard that insects are a delicacy in South Borea. Do you want a bun?</string>

  <string id="7007">With the machine?</string>
  <string id="7008">-&gt;$9014</string>

  <string id="7014">Emma? She's a good girl. She's a flirt and makes herself up like a hooker, but she's a good girl. She always buys the strongest coffee.</string>
  <string id="7015">Makes sense - you can't get a good night's sleep if you're up screwing your boyfriends all night long.</string>
  <string id="7403">As far as I know, Emma works a lot, that’s why she doesn’t get enough sleep.</string>
  <string id="7404">Oh really? I'd like to see her try to get up at 4 a.m. like I do, cook pies, feed the children, listen to the political information broadcasts, and then heave this tray around all day!</string>
  <string id="7405">Well if you don't believe me, go hit on her yourself! See how that bimbo butters up her rolls right away!</string>

  <string id="7025">I don't sell alcohol. You need a license for that!</string>
  <string id="7026">No, not that... But maybe you might have headache pills on you?</string>
  <string id="7027">My pies don't cause headaches. I've only got laxatives. Need ‘em?</string>

  <string id="7411">So I just give him my share and keep a low profile. Away from the bosses, closer to the monies, you know.</string>
  <string id="7412">Ask how business is going</string>

  <string id="7418">The lottery!</string>
  <string id="7419">What lottery?</string>
  <string id="7420">A guaranteed-prize lottery! Buy a pie on Monday to participate!</string>
  <string id="7421">And what is the prize?</string>
  <string id="7422">Either you get full, or get to take sick leave! Depends on your luck.</string>
  <string id="7423">What are those pies made out of?</string>
  <string id="7424">Meat!</string>
  <string id="7425">The kind that oinks?</string>

  <string id="7428">Anything you want!</string>
  <string id="7429">I like liver pies.</string>
  <string id="7430">Out of them. Have a pasta one!</string>
  <string id="7431">Pasta pies?!</string>
  <string id="7432">Pretty nifty, huh? Came up with the recipe myself. There's always a line to take meat home from the canteen, but nobody wants the pasta leftovers.</string>
  <string id="7433">And I've got to sell something, right?</string>
  <string id="7434">How come meat pies are cheaper than potato pies?</string>
  <string id="7435">Situational marketing!</string>
  <string id="7436">-&gt;$5706</string>
  <string id="7437">Potatoes can't be cheaper than cardboard. It's supposed to be that way. Don't distract me from work.</string>
  <string id="7438">Planning on expanding your range?</string>
  <string id="7439">Nah, I'm good.</string>
  <string id="7440">But more products means more money.</string>
  <string id="7441">Well I can't earn all of it, can I? Besides, I'm working my ass off already.</string>
  <string id="7442">Where do you get all these fillings?</string>
  <string id="7443">Trade secret!</string>
  <string id="7445">-&gt;$7444</string>
  <string id="7446">At the market, after it closes. So much yummy stuff gets left behind!</string>
  <string id="7447">Got anything else but the pies?</string>
  <string id="7448">Sure! Rheumatism, three kids and a color TV.</string>
  <string id="7449">For sale, I mean.</string>
  <string id="7450">Only the pies are for sale.</string>
  <string id="7451">Talk about trading in the Ministry</string>
  <string id="7452">How do you make it past security? The Ministry is a restricted-access area!</string>
  <string id="7454">Ask for details</string>
  <string id="7455">When it was shut down to cut costs, folks started dying of starvation right at their workplaces, so the bosses had to okay selling food here.</string>
  <string id="7456">And nobody stops you?</string>
  <string id="7457">I'd love to see ‘em try!</string>
  <string id="7458">Wow, so you’re quite a big shot?</string>
  <string id="7459">Please! I started out as a janitor here. You know how it goes, though - nobody pays attention to the hired help. I've seen and heard a lot.</string>
  <string id="7460">Once the canteen got shut down, I put two and two together and went straight to the boss.</string>
  <string id="7461">We agreed on an amount fairly quick. The security chief, though, became a problem.</string>
  <string id="7462">So I had to remind him of what happened on the Day of Order a couple years ago, and he came to his senses pretty sharpish. Ever since, security just smile and wave at me.</string>
  <string id="7463">What happened?</string>
  <string id="7464">Yeah, right! Want to start smuggling pies, too? And take my job away?</string>

  <string id="7469">No, thanks, I'm good with the one I've got. Just curious how you manage to do so much.</string>
  <string id="7470">I’m not gonna discuss my family with you. What do you care?</string>
  <string id="7471">How many kids do you have?</string>
  <string id="7472">Had three. One got drafted during the first Western campaign. The war did away with him in a month. The second one showed up again recently: shell-shocked, says he got discharged.</string>
  <string id="7473">Huge fella with baby-brain. Gotta feed him like a toddler. My third one… Oh well, I'm talking too much, gotta go.</string>
  <string id="7474">Where's your husband?</string>
  <string id="7475">Ate too many pears!</string>
  <string id="7477">-&gt;$7476</string>
  <string id="7478">I once brought home some pears for my youngest. Traded for ‘em at the market. And that drunken swine knocked back a bottle of moonshine and ate ‘em all!</string>
  <string id="7479">And what happened?</string>
  <string id="7480">Well, I was young… strong… He fell very ill, so to say… I remember the blood gushing out of his nose and everything… And that's how he died. Food poisoning! Terrible business!</string>
  <string id="7481">Are your parents alive?</string>
  <string id="7482">After our youngest was born, they invited us to the city to live with them. They have a huge room in social housing here.</string>
  <string id="7483">So there are five of us, but at least there's always someone to change the IV when you need to…</string>
  <string id="7484">IV?</string>
  <string id="7485">My youngest was born sick. Needs meds. And I'm no nurse. All I know is how to make pies.</string>
  <string id="7486">Is anyone helping you?</string>
  <string id="7487">Sure! The Leader's tender care and our constant victories on the battlefront!</string>
  <string id="7488">Are you kidding?</string>
  <string id="7489">Whaddaya mean?… Can't you see how I'm practically basking in care?</string>
  <string id="7491">Have you heard?! Somebody in the Ministry is selling drugs!</string>
  <string id="7492">Good for them. Thought of doing it myself, but I don't know much about them.</string>
  <string id="7493">Would you like to know more?</string>
  <string id="7494">Oh, don't you tempt me! I've just got myself off the mouthwash!</string>
  <string id="7495">But I have an idea you might like!</string>
  <string id="7496">Hm?</string>
  <string id="7497">I need to get something past security. You help me, I help you…</string>
  <string id="7498">So you’re a smart cookie, eh! Just got here, and getting busy already! You'll go far!</string>
  <string id="7499">I will if you help me. So?</string>
  <string id="7500">Getting past security is no big deal. But you see, donuts on their own aren't enough. The vending machine sells candy bars, and that ruins my business.</string>

  <string id="7503">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="7504">You bet I do! I'll see what I can arrange.</string>

  <string id="7506">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="7507">I need time to think. The vending machine is out in the open…</string>
  <string id="7508">Think, but don't take too long!</string>
  <string id="7509">Serena, you're poisoning employees with drugs!</string>
  <string id="7510">Not poisoning! I just add some to their coffee to make their lives a bit better!</string>
  <string id="7511">Stop it!</string>
  <string id="7512">Why? I've never had so much money in my life! I've got a family to look after!</string>
  <string id="7513">Hi, Serena! What's new? Anything good going on today?</string>
  <string id="7514">As if!</string>
  <string id="7515">What happened?</string>
  <string id="7516">That damn vending machine is what happened! They put those metal monsters everywhere, as if they can make buns as delish as mine!</string>
  <string id="7517">Agree the buns are good</string>
  <string id="7518">Your buns are the best! I'm sure your clientele isn't going anywhere!</string>
  <string id="7519">It already has! Every night I look at my sales figures and weep! A couple more weeks like this, and I'm done!</string>
  <string id="7520">That serious, eh?</string>
  <string id="7521">If someone broke that damn thing completely, I'd shower him with gold! That's how serious it is!</string>
  <string id="7525">So, what do you say? Help auntie Serena and make a little dough?</string>
  <string id="7526">I never liked that machine either. Deal.</string>
  <string id="7527">Thank you so much, sweetie! I'll never forget it! But really do your worst, alright? I've heard the only irreplaceable part of the machine is the reactor.</string>
  <string id="7528">Bring it to me, and the money's yours.</string>
  <string id="7529">I'd love to, but I'm too busy right now. Some other time.</string>
  <string id="7530">You might come some other time, and I ain't here anymore! And that'll be on you! Go away now, I've got work to do!</string>
  <string id="7531">Criticize the buns</string>
  <string id="7532">Your buns could be used to hammer nails into concrete!</string>
  <string id="7533">Shame on you, talking about an old lady's buns like that! I work on 'em every night, I’ll have you know!</string>
  <string id="7534">Get lost now, I've got stuff to do!</string>
  <string id="7535">Hello, Serena! How's business?</string>
  <string id="7536">You tell me how business should be... What with that vending machine still vending away over there! Will you do something 'bout it, or should I find someone gutsier?</string>
  <string id="7537">I'm working on it.</string>
  <string id="7538">I'm coming up with a plan. Breaking the machine is easy; getting caught, less so...</string>
  <string id="7539">You'd better hurry, my little hunchback, before I run out of customers!</string>
  <string id="7540">Tell her about the results</string>
  <string id="7541">No need to look for anyone else. Here's your reactor.</string>
  <string id="7542">Oh you sweetheart! Thank you so much!</string>
  <string id="7543">Let me know if you need to get something past security!</string>
  <string id="7544">Here, for your trouble.</string>
  <string id="7545">Hello, Serena! Got any snacks?</string>
  <string id="7546">What for? I never snack.</string>
  <string id="7547">I meant for sale. My colleagues and I are planning a little party.</string>
  <string id="7548">Oh, sure! I’ve got Redfish sandwiches, sausage sandwiches, and cheese sandwiches. Which do you fancy?</string>
  <string id="7549">Ask about fish</string>
  <string id="7550">Redfish? That's a rarity!</string>
  <string id="7551">Well, it’s red, yes… It's herring, soaked in beet juice overnight.</string>
  <string id="7552">Ask about sausage</string>
  <string id="7553">Is the sausage fresh?</string>
  <string id="7554">I'll tell you this much: it’s only going to get fresher!</string>
  <string id="7555">Ask about cheese</string>
  <string id="7556">What kind of cheese? I don’t suppose you have any gorgonzola, by any chance?</string>
  <string id="7557">What's that?</string>
  <string id="7558">A type of blue cheese with a sublime mold - a delicacy highly valued by connoisseurs…</string>
  <string id="7559">Well, my lovely donut, not just cheese then! In my basement I've got gorgonzola potatoes, gorgonzola beetroot, gorgonzola pickles, and gorgonzola sausage! Your connoisseurs would go nuts!</string>
  <string id="7561">Enjoy the party! But if anyone starts throwing up, see if they’re pregnant first before you start pointing fingers at me!</string>

  <string id="7863">Ask about bachelors</string>
  <string id="7864">What do you think people eat in restricted areas - air? They used to have a whole canteen on this floor.</string>
  <string id="7865">Tell me, Serena, are there any eligible bachelors in our Ministry?</string>
  <string id="7866">Batches of bachelors and stacks of studs. Wait, watcha need them for? Are you one of those types?</string>
  <string id="7867">No, it’s not for me. A friend of mine wants to find herself a husband.</string>
  <string id="7868">And here I thought... Well, I don’t know anyone suitable - you should look through the mail on your computer-thingy, maybe someone posted an ad.</string>
  <string id="7869">Okay, thanks, Serena.</string>

  <string id="10819">-&gt;$10737</string>

  <string id="10822">For them?</string>
  <string id="10823">For me. Foodies like that are too hard to please.</string>
  <string id="10824">Did you hear about the explosion in the new wing?</string>
  <string id="10825">Of course I did, I'm not deaf! That was one hell of an explosion!</string>
  <string id="10826">They’re saying that people died...</string>
  <string id="10827">Did you know them?</string>
  <string id="10828">Of course not!</string>
  <string id="10829">Well, then quit blubbering about it! My work kills me too, but nobody’s crying over it. Why not have an artichoke pie instead?</string>

  <string id="14849">That courier, Page, has something for sale. There's also a merchant, but he might be hard to find.</string>
  <string id="14850">Do you know where I can find him?</string>
  <string id="14851">He used to work at 6 Krushvice St., and then moved past Lightenment Square.</string>
  <string id="14852">Enlightenment?</string>
  <string id="14853">No, Lightenment. The letters on the sign faded out, so they entered it into the register like that. Look for him there.</string>
  <string id="14854">How will I recognize him?</string>
  <string id="14855">You’ll know him when you see him! He wears an old-fashioned top hat to make himself more noticeable from afar. You shouldn't have any problems!</string>

  <string id="8697">Everything is just wonderful! Henry is very kind to me - and especially to the children. We’re just two halves of a whole!</string>
  <string id="8698">Henry and I talked it over and decided to give you a small gift for what you’ve done for us!</string>
  <string id="8699">No, Emma...</string>
  <string id="8700">We knew that you’d refuse, so we just transferred some money to your account. Thanks again, Evan! See you!</string>
  <string id="8701">Hello?</string>
  <string id="8702">Hello! This is the auto-informer of the Service for Monitoring the Activities of Ministry Employees. We would like to inform you that, in the course of an official investigation, video surveillance equipment recorded a sexual relation between... Evan Redgrave... and Ministry employee.... Emma Hazer...</string>
  <string id="8703">Hey, is there anyone there?</string>
  <string id="8704">...Also, as a result of this intercourse, bacteriological diagnostic control has registered the infection of... Evan Redgrave... With a sexually transmitted disease.</string>
  <string id="8705">-&gt;$10675</string>
  <string id="8706">... You have been issued a fine and a bill for treatment. All hail the Leader!</string>
  <string id="12603">Have you found anything out about your father?</string>
  <string id="12604">I'll tell you when I see you.</string>
  <string id="12605">I won't be coming soon, dear. But I understand that it’s not a conversation for the telephone. Just do what you have to. Everything is good with the two of us!</string>
  <string id="12606">I’m so glad to hear that! Could you say it again?</string>
  <string id="12607">We’re fine, Evan. We don't need anything, and everything's calm in Redding. Focus on your work, dear. I know this is important to you.</string>
  <string id="12608">Our girl will finally have her own room!</string>
  <string id="12609">I really want to see you…</string>
  <string id="12610">So do I. I have to go now - hang up!</string>
  <string id="12611">No, you hang up!</string>
  <string id="12612">We miss you too, honey! I have to go now, hang up!</string>
  <string id="12613">How is the investigation going?</string>
  <string id="12614">Ferguson isn’t very talkative, especially when I ask about my father.</string>
  <string id="12615">I recently learned that Ferguson is putting together some kind of party. It's not easy to get in. No one knows what goes there.</string>
  <string id="12616">A boring ministerial meeting to report all the work that’s been done?</string>
  <string id="12617">Possibly. It’s a good opportunity to get some valuable info out of Ferguson.</string>
  <string id="12618">I can't get into an event like that, so I want you to install a camera. I need to know what's going on in there.</string>
  <string id="12619">Where will I get a camera?</string>
  <string id="12620">Talk to your building manager. Or security. Install the camera in Ferguson's office and pass it on to me after the party.</string>
  <string id="12621">Ask about the building manager</string>
  <string id="12622">How do you know that he has surveillance cameras?</string>
  <string id="12623">If he doesn’t have any cameras, then they’re all already in your apartment.</string>
  <string id="12624">-&gt;$13911</string>
  <string id="12625">Why would security give me a camera?</string>
  <string id="12626">Because every employee is allowed a camera for observing their colleagues!</string>
  <string id="12627">Ask about getting a camera</string>
  <string id="12628">Why can’t you just give me a camera?</string>
  <string id="12629">What a stupid question, Evan! The fewer links there are between us, the lower the likelihood of you getting caught.</string>
  <string id="12630">Hello, Evan? It’s James. I’ve been looking into your colleagues. They’re an interesting bunch!</string>
  <string id="12631">I'm listening.</string>
  <string id="12632">In general, there’s nothing too unusual - but keep an eye on John Smith.</string>
  <string id="12633">What's wrong with him?</string>
  <string id="12634">We don’t have any information on him, and that's suspicious.</string>
  <string id="12635">What do you want me to do?</string>
  <string id="12636">I don't think it’s a serious matter, but if I were you I would find out everything there is to know about him. Put a request in with the Archive and let me know if you find anything, okay?</string>
  <string id="12637">I'll try!</string>
  <string id="14928">-&gt;$14927</string>
  <string id="14929">Evan, it is me.</string>
  <string id="14930">“Me” who?</string>
  <string id="14931">Maria Curie.</string>
  <string id="14932">Oh! It's nice to hear you! Did everything go okay?</string>
  <string id="14933">Yes, now I am safe. Thanks to you. Thank you, Evan!</string>
  <string id="14934">Don't mention it! How's your baby?</string>
  <string id="14935">I did tests. He has the Down's syndrome.</string>
  <string id="14936">Oh... I'm sorry. What are you going to do?</string>
  <string id="14937">You remember, I am geneticist? It will be okay.</string>
  <string id="14938">Well… Good luck.</string>
  <string id="14939">I sent you money. As thank you.</string>
  <string id="14940">Why? You didn't need to do that.</string>
  <string id="14941">I did need! I would be dead if I didn’t have your help. I am returning the debt! Sorry - I have to go!</string>
  <string id="14743">Hello! Evan? This is Amelia Weiss! I'd like to thank you!</string>
  <string id="14750">Yeah, Evan, it’s wonderful! I found a new job that I like and where my work is appreciated! All thanks to you!</string>
  <string id="14753">Wow, I’m so glad to hear that, Amelia! Amelia?... Hello?</string>
  <string id="15153">So, tell me about the apartment. Do you like it?</string>
  <string id="8707">Hello, James? It’s Evan Redgrave.</string>

  <string id="8736">Young man! You are wasting my time!</string>
  <string id="8737">-&gt;$10353</string>
  <string id="8738">Would this be enough to solve the problem?</string>
  <string id="8740">Young man, do you even have that kind of money?</string>
  <string id="8741">Call later</string>
  <string id="8742">I'll call you later.</string>
  <string id="8743">Hello, is this Henry Legrand?</string>
  <string id="8745">My name is Evan Redgrave, I work with your son in the Ministry. Marco asked me to call and tell you that he’s found himself a girl and they're going to get married.</string>
  <string id="8746">Wonderful news! What's her name?</string>
  <string id="8747">Her name is Emma Hazer, she's our colleague.</string>
  <string id="8748">What a beautiful name! Could you tell her that I want to meet her? I'll write an invitation in her name!</string>
  <string id="8749">Yes, of course, I'll let her know. Goodbye!</string>
  <string id="12638">Let's start with your immediate superior, Pete Ferguson. He is a pathetic man who loves only money. You'll see for yourself soon enough.</string>
  <string id="12639">Pete knows whose son you are - everyone does - so he’ll be careful.</string>
  <string id="12640">You’ll need to gain his trust if you want to get him to slip up. Gather some information about him - squeeze it out of him, talk to colleagues, fulfill a few of his requests... If your conscience allows you to, of course…</string>
  <string id="12641">We need some dirt on that arrogant son of a bitch.</string>
  <string id="12642">But don't forget that Ferguson is just the first step - he’s not that important. Your main goal is to rise through the ranks. You’re working on the first floor at the moment. You have to make your way up higher.</string>
  <string id="12643">So either build up your Authority, ruin your boss or get rid of colleagues who pose you any competition.</string>
  <string id="12644">How do I get a promotion</string>
  <string id="12645">There’s a standard procedure. You get promoted when you earn enough Authority. Use the work phone to find out how much you need.</string>
  <string id="12646">I can’t help you much with Authority. You have to work, strengthen the Ministry's power and the Leader's glory, get colleagues out of your way or befriend them.</string>
  <string id="12647">-&gt;$6666</string>
  <string id="12648">Your colleagues are your competitors. Make them not be your competitors.</string>
  <string id="12649">If you find another way - go for it. Ask them to withdraw, arrange a transfer to another department or wear them down.</string>
  <string id="12650">It makes no difference to me. I’m only interested in the result - the victory!</string>
  <string id="12651">-&gt;$6265</string>
  <string id="12652">To hell with this Hemnitz. Keep on working!</string>
  <string id="12653">You should have said so from the beginning! Bring your children, we'll take them in.</string>

  <string id="12702">Hello, I need to talk to Dr. Alfred Binet.</string>
  <string id="12703">About what?</string>
  <string id="12704">It’s about a patient of his.</string>
  <string id="12705">She’s my colleague, and she's been acting strange lately. I’d like to discuss her illness.</string>
  <string id="12706">We don't discuss patients with third parties.</string>
  <string id="12707">I am an employee of the Ministry. My questions are none of your business.</string>
  <string id="12708">Just a second!</string>
  <string id="12709">Yes? I'm listening.</string>
  <string id="12710">Dr. Alfred Binet? My name is Evan Redgrave, I work with a certain Gloria Melfi. Are you familiar with her?</string>
  <string id="12711">Gloria Melfi? Of course! What's the matter?</string>
  <string id="12712">She’s acting a little oddly.</string>
  <string id="12713">That’s no wonder - such a difficult case! We treated her four years ago.</string>
  <string id="12714">I called the Archive - they told me that her son died in a crash. Could that be the cause of her illness?</string>
  <string id="12715">It is. I tried to tell her about what happened, but instead of accepting it, she became hysterical - her brain refused to accept the news about her son. We treated her with drugs for two years, and she had started to recover.</string>
  <string id="12716">She was soon discharged. Why are you asking about her?</string>
  <string id="12717">She constantly talks about her son as if he was alive. It’s causing us some problems.</string>
  <string id="12718">I’m very sorry to hear that. So, her condition has worsened again? Tell me: has she, by any chance, mixed you up with him?</string>
  <string id="12719">Yes, it’s happened a few times.</string>
  <string id="12720">That is very bad!</string>
  <string id="12721">What should we do? Maybe you can take her in again?</string>
  <string id="12722">I’m afraid that all the beds in the psychiatric ward are occupied for years to come. But you can try to resolve the issue yourself if you want.</string>
  <string id="12723">How?</string>
  <string id="12724">This is an experimental method, and there may be come side effects. But if you play along and pretend to be her son, it might work. You need to gain her trust and gradually pull her out of her delirium.</string>
  <string id="12725">If you do, there is a chance that she’ll accept his death and recover.</string>
  <string id="12726">Pretend to be her son?</string>
  <string id="12727">Yes, but there is one thing: if she suspects that something is wrong, her psyche won't be able to cope with it - and then anything can happen!</string>
  <string id="12729">-&gt;$12728</string>
  <string id="12730">She may attack the one who’s deceived her. Or kill herself, because she is tormented by a terrible feeling of guilt and loneliness.</string>
  <string id="12731">How do I avoid that?</string>
  <string id="12732">Anyone who assumes this responsibility should learn as much as possible about her son, and play their part perfectly.</string>
  <string id="12733">Sounds hard...</string>
  <string id="12734">Well, you can also wait until she finally loses it and gets sent to the House of Misfits. That could happen tomorrow, a year from now, or never - in which case she’ll live the rest of her life in her delusions.</string>
  <string id="12735">Agree to the experiment</string>
  <string id="12736">Fine, doctor, I'll try!</string>
  <string id="12737">I'll tell you what I can. My nephew studied with Melfi's son at School No. 0261. I knew her before the tragedy and I’m invested in her recovery.</string>
  <string id="12738">I repeat: before you pretend to be Gloria's son, learn as much about him as possible. Good luck! Now, my patients are waiting for me.</string>
  <string id="12739">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="12740">I think I'll pass! I don't like this idea.</string>
  <string id="12741">You swine! I'm not chatting to you instead of working just so that you can refuse to help a good and honest woman.</string>
  <string id="12742">I told you that Gloria Melfi is seriously ill.</string>

  <string id="12750">Can you help me?</string>
  <string id="12751">Of course I can. You wouldn't be calling this number otherwise. Where are you, sweetheart?</string>
  <string id="12752">I’ll meet you at the entrance to the Ministry.</string>

  <string id="12756">Food poisoning</string>
  <string id="12757">I ate something bad! My stomach is killing me!</string>
  <string id="12758">And why do you eat garbage? Eat what's good for you and don't bother people with such trivial matters!</string>
  <string id="12759">Injury</string>
  <string id="12760">I was taking a bath, slipped and broke my arm!</string>
  <string id="12761">But not your leg? Then you can come here yourself!</string>
  <string id="12762">Why are you talking to me like that? I’ll file a complaint!</string>
  <string id="12763">Then you’ll also find yourself with a broken jaw! Don't distract people from their work!</string>
  <string id="12764">Heart attack</string>
  <string id="12765">I think I'm having a heart attack!</string>
  <string id="12766">You “think” you are, or you are?</string>
  <string id="12767">You see, I got a bonus today, and there was so much money that…</string>
  <string id="12768">Understood, we'll be right there! The heart is a serious matter!</string>
  <string id="12769">Fever</string>
  <string id="12770">I have a fever!</string>
  <string id="12771">You'll save on your heating, then!</string>
  <string id="12772">You have to help me!</string>
  <string id="12773">We have to help you with your fever, the Ministry of Distribution has to help us with medicine, and we all have to love the Wise Leader for his tireless care for us. See how it all goes smoothly? All the best, take care of yourself!</string>

  <string id="12778">But it's too early to rest on your laurels. Now everything will get even more difficult. Your task is the same: you have to find some dirt on your next boss. Get to know him, gain his trust and find something on him.</string>

  <string id="12780">Got it, James.</string>
  <string id="12781">And be extremely careful. I heard that things aren’t so simple on this floor - judging by the sheets, they have a wild staff turnover rate. So keep an ear to the ground!</string>

  <string id="12783">I never doubted you, not even for a second. Well done!</string>
  <string id="12784">A little more and you’ll find yourself at the top. Start working on your next boss. Get to know him, gain his trust and find something on him.</string>
  <string id="12785">Or just get your colleagues out of the way and climb up the career ladder to the next floor.</string>

  <string id="12789">Now what? What’s our next move?</string>
  <string id="12790">Sorry to disappoint you, but I don’t have a next move. We are entering terra incognita - I have no idea what awaits us on the top floor. Your father always fell silent when I asked about it…</string>
  <string id="12791">I don't mean to be rude, James, but... ARE YOU SHITTING ME?! I’ve worked all the way up to the top and you don’t know what I’m going to find there?!</string>
  <string id="12792">You’ll find answers, Evan. That I’m sure of. And this time I'm coming with you. Your clearance allows you to bring visitors with you - you’re one of the gods now.</string>
  <string id="12793">Thank you, James. Honestly, I’d feel better with you around.</string>
  <string id="12794">We won't leave a single question unanswered: Heimdall, the death of your father, all the injustices perpetrated in the name of the Leader - we’ll find the answers to every question and hold the guilty accountable! Meet me near the elevator, Evan!</string>

  <string id="12808">That bastard has a whole torture palace under his office. And “palace” is an understatement! It’s a whole other world of nightmares, where he tortures and kills dozens, even hundreds of people!</string>
  <string id="12809">That son of a... But... He's smart, Evan. He’ll simply make it look as though he was dealing with enemies of the state or something like that…</string>
  <string id="12810">Hell no! I found the unthinkable, James... He... that bastard... there were children…</string>
  <string id="12811">... ... ... ... ... I have no words…</string>
  <string id="12812">You have to stop that monster! Or I won't do a damn thing for you anymore! Do you hear me?!</string>
  <string id="12813">That's why I sent you there. You and I will make this world a little better. Let’s meet at the subway tomorrow - that freak will get what he deserves.</string>
  <string id="12814">Say that you were mistaken</string>
  <string id="12815">There’s nothing on him, James.</string>
  <string id="12816">Evan, while we stumble around in circles, those bastards keep twisting the Leader’s legacy every day, turning the Great State into a landfill! Get it together and call me when you find something important!</string>
  <string id="12817">Talk about John Smith</string>
  <string id="12818">Hello, James? Evan. It's about Smith. There is clearly something wrong with him!</string>
  <string id="12819">You noticed it too?</string>
  <string id="12820">The Archive has nothing on him but his name. All the fields are empty. No parents, no relatives, nothing.</string>
  <string id="12821">Hmm... There can only be one explanation - someone “cleaned up” his file!</string>
  <string id="12822">But why erase information about a run-of-the-mill employee?</string>
  <string id="12823">I don't know, Evan, I don't know... It seems that this John Smith isn’t as run-of-the-mill as he seems…</string>
  <string id="12824">-&gt;$13646</string>
  <string id="12825">He doesn't look like a tough guy and he obviously has some kind of secret... I think you can scare him a little with the information that we have. Maybe he'll crack.</string>
  <string id="12827">-&gt;$12826</string>
  <string id="12828">Talk about Isaac Weinberg</string>
  <string id="12829">Evan, did you find anything on Weinberg?</string>
  <string id="12830">Report Weinberg</string>
  <string id="12831">Weinberg is crazy! He plans to replace all people with his damn clones!</string>
  <string id="12832">That could be interpreted as the fantasies of a scientist who got a little carried away with his brainchild. Do you have any proof?</string>
  <string id="12833">Isn’t the fact that he’s practically planning a coup enough? I have a whole bible written by him! It describes his every step!</string>
  <string id="12834">That's better! Tomorrow morning I’ll arrest him and we’ll remove another piece from the board! Meet me at the subway.</string>
  <string id="12835">Talk about Pete Ferguson</string>
  <string id="12836">Hello, Evan. How did everything go? Did Ferguson have his party?</string>
  <string id="12837">Calling it a party is like saying that a person with a severed head has a small migraine.</string>
  <string id="12838">That bad?</string>
  <string id="12839">James, why do I imagine you rubbing your hands in glee when you say “bad”? But yes, you’re right. It was the most unruly and debauched thing I’ve ever seen.</string>
  <string id="12840">I hoped you filmed everything?</string>
  <string id="12841">I couldn't install the camera.</string>
  <string id="12842">Damn it, Evan! That was our only way to get dirt on him.</string>
  <string id="12843">Now it’s going to be hard for you to get a promotion.</string>
  <string id="12844">So either gain more Authority or take care of your competitors if you can't gain Pete's trust. Damn... I had such high hopes for that recording!</string>
  <string id="12845">Say that you have the recording</string>
  <string id="12846">I have the recording.</string>
  <string id="12847">Well done! I’ll arrest that bloodsucker in the morning! I'll meet you at the subway - you’re coming with me. I think you deserve to witness it.</string>
  <string id="12848">Great job, Evan!</string>
  <string id="12849">Keep the recording to yourself</string>
  <string id="12850">I didn't manage to pick up the film. Someone probably found the camera and turned it off.</string>
  <string id="12851">Say goodbye</string>
  <string id="12852">Excuse me, my name is Evan Redgrave, Nathan Kehler gave me your number.</string>
  <string id="12853">The old rascal is still alive? Funny. But a name alone doesn't tell me anything.</string>
  <string id="12854">He told me that you’re capable of decisive action.</string>
  <string id="12855">Maybe.</string>
  <string id="12856">Sorry, how can I address you?</string>
  <string id="12857">Call me George Danton.</string>
  <string id="12858">George, I need your help with a delicate matter. There’s a chemical plant in the suburbs. It’s poisoning the whole district.</string>
  <string id="12859">And what does that have to do with me?</string>
  <string id="12860">I want you to help me shut down the factory.</string>
  <string id="12861">Do you work for their competitors?</string>
  <string id="12862">No, I just want to help people! We have to organize an anti-pollution strike at the factory!</string>
  <string id="12863">An anti-pollution strike? What was your... Evan! You know absolutely nothing about the revolutionary struggle against the capitalists. They must be destroyed!</string>
  <string id="12864">No! I don't want there to be any casualties!</string>
  <string id="12865">I hear you. We’ll take on your case. We will prove that The New Tomorrow is capable of real action!</string>
  <string id="12866">I have a guy with all the information about this situation. Can I tell him to contact you?</string>
  <string id="12867">Deal. All hail the Lead-... Damn.. Revolution or Death!</string>
  <string id="14942">Request information about Carl Stein</string>
  <string id="14943">James, it’s Evan!</string>
  <string id="14944">I'm listening.</string>
  <string id="14945">I found Albert DeSalvo's secret shelter! He’s built a secret room under his office where he tortures and kills people!</string>
  <string id="14946">A secret room? Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="14947">Absolutely! Can we arrest him now?</string>
  <string id="14948">Not so fast, Evan. I'm sure that he'll find a plausible explanation for everything. He’ll say that he’s been torturing enemies of the state - and, naturally, they’ll believe him.</string>
  <string id="14949">So what do I do?</string>
  <string id="14950">We need something more than torture and murder.</string>
  <string id="14951">More? Like what?</string>
  <string id="14952">I don't know. You need to find something in that room that we can use to nail him to the wall.</string>
  <string id="14953">Fine, James, I'll try. Although I can’t imagine anything worse. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="14954">Embassy of South Borea. I'm listening.</string>
  <string id="14955">I have information about a citizen of your country - Maria Curie.</string>
  <string id="14956">Who's speaking?</string>
  <string id="14957">It doesn't matter!</string>
  <string id="14958">It does! Maria Curie disappeared a few months ago in unclear circumstances while attending a scientific conference.</string>
  <string id="14959">Consider me a well-wisher. Maria was kidnapped by the special services of our state and is being forced to work on our projects.</string>
  <string id="14960">Can you tell me where she's being held?</string>
  <string id="14961">She’s at the Ministry during the day, and at night she’s taken to Residential Block No. 4. She has a translator. And... She’s pregnant…</string>
  <string id="14962">And what do you want from us?</string>
  <string id="14963">Just help her get out! She won't last long here.</string>
  <string id="14964">Thank you for contacting us. We will make every effort to free her!</string>
  <string id="14965">I want to request information about Carl Stein.</string>
  <string id="14966">Fulfilling request…</string>
  <string id="14967">Carl Stein. Personal file classified.</string>
  <string id="14968">The dossier was destroyed by order of the Ministry of Cutting-Edge Scientific Developments.</string>
  <string id="14969">Last place of work - the manager of a Class D apartment building at 6 Krushvice St.</string>
  <string id="14970">Thank you. That's something to go on!</string>
  <string id="15143">Say that you don't have the recording</string>
  <string id="15144">I don't have the recording with me...</string>
  <string id="15145">Evan, without that recording from the party, we don’t have anything on him. Call me when you have that tape.</string>
  <string id="7093">I need to go to work. It's too early to go home.</string>
  <string id="7870">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="7871">Marco Legrand sent me.</string>
  <string id="7872">Marco sent me. You have something for me.</string>

  <string id="7878">Where are your parents, little girl? What's your name? Are you lost?</string>
  <string id="7879">No. My mom works in the Ministry, and I wait for her here after school. When she finishes her work, we'll go home.</string>
  <string id="7880">My name is Anka, what's yours?</string>
  <string id="7881">I'm Evan!</string>
  <string id="7882">Hi, sir!</string>
  <string id="7883">Ask why she's not going home</string>
  <string id="7884">Why don't you go home?</string>
  <string id="7885">It's boring! The radio keeps saying “blah-blah-blah, war this, war that”… So I figured I’d train beetles to keep myself busy!</string>
  <string id="7886">I found them in the bushes! A whole bunch! Though mom won't let me bring them inside. She says the building manager will get mad.</string>
  <string id="7887">Talk about talking to strangers</string>
  <string id="7888">Didn’t your mom tell you to not talk to strangers?</string>
  <string id="7889">Yeah.</string>
  <string id="7890">So how come you're talking to me?</string>
  <string id="7891">Don't you remember? I told you, my name is Anka. So now we're not strangers.</string>
  <string id="7893">-&gt;$7892</string>
  <string id="7894">I see you've got a whole bug circus!</string>
  <string id="7895">Yes! They're trained! They can do anything! I haven’t taught them to do anything yet, though…</string>
  <string id="7896">Ask to collect the beetles</string>
  <string id="7897">I want cool bugs like that too! Can you get a couple for me and put them in a bag?</string>
  <string id="7898">Sure! And what will you give me in return?</string>
  <string id="7899">I'll bring you a piece of candy later.</string>
  <string id="7900">Candy makes my teeth hurt! I want</string>
  <string id="7901">Ask what she needs that much for</string>
  <string id="7902">Whoa! What on Earth do you need that much money for?</string>
  <string id="7903">Mom had a fight with our building manager recently. He said we need to</string>
  <string id="7904">pay up. And then mom cried…</string>
  <string id="7905">Pay for beetles</string>
  <string id="7906">Here's the money.</string>
  <string id="7907">Here's your bugs! Train them well, though, or they might escape!</string>

  <string id="7912">-&gt;$11897</string>
  <string id="7913">You work for the Ministry, right?</string>
  <string id="7914">That's right. How did you know?</string>
  <string id="7915">Nothing special, I’m just professionally observant.</string>
  <string id="7916">You work with Marco Legrand, right? Give him this envelope, it's very important.</string>

  <string id="7920">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="7921">Sorry, but we have very strict guidelines. You can't bring outside materials into the Ministry.</string>

  <string id="7927">I decided that bureaucracy shouldn't get between people. Give me your envelope, I'll take it to Legrand.</string>
  <string id="7928">I agree completely! Thank you so much!</string>

  <string id="7948">You talked to me! Thank you! The thing is, I can't get anyone to help me!</string>
  <string id="7949">My line, over there, isn't moving at all! I've been waiting for a week now, and haven't moved an inch!</string>
  <string id="7950">And how can I help? Just keep waiting. Everyone else does!</string>
  <string id="7951">But look at it, really! That window is closed! I can't just keep standing here!</string>

  <string id="7953">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="7954">OK, what window number is it?</string>
  <string id="7955">Number 101.</string>

  <string id="7957">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="7958">Sorry, but I'm really busy here. Try asking someone else.</string>
  <string id="7959">We still haven’t moved... Can you please check?</string>
  <string id="7960">Okay, but I can't promise anything.</string>
  <string id="7961">In any case, thank you. If it starts moving, it'll be the best day of my life!</string>
  <string id="7962">I'm still too busy.</string>
  <string id="7963">Of course! You work for the Ministry, and we're just simple folk…</string>
  <string id="7964">So? Are they going to start taking applications?</string>
  <string id="7965">Still working on it, I’ll keep you posted.</string>
  <string id="7966">I have good news and bad news. Which do you want first?</string>
  <string id="7967">Bad!</string>
  <string id="7968">The employee from that window died from exhaustion at his desk a week ago.</string>
  <string id="7969">That's awful! What's the good news?</string>
  <string id="7970">You’re now free to go stand in a different line.</string>
  <string id="7971">You know what… Think I'll just go home. I wanted to get the reward for turning in banned books, but I doubt it'll cover my expenses. You can take the book, if you want; I'm not carrying it back home!</string>
  <string id="7972">Agree</string>
  <string id="7973">Thanks. I know what to do with it.</string>

  <string id="8105">See, you're already interested! My company, “Wings”, offers personal development training - including self-satisfaction training. You want to like yourself, don't you?</string>
  <string id="8106">I already do!</string>
  <string id="8107">That’s great! You're so sure of yourself! Please take our leaflets and spread the word at work! Let everyone be happy!</string>
  <string id="8108">Okay.</string>
  <string id="8027">Hear the word of the Leader! Open up your soul to him! Join us, The Word of the Leader, to get answers to all your questions!</string>
  <string id="8028">All of them?</string>
  <string id="8029">The Leader's wisdom knows no limits! You don't have to think or choose anymore; the Leader has all the answers! Just come to us and find out!</string>
  <string id="8030">What question is bothering you?</string>
  <string id="8031">Who killed my father?</string>
  <string id="8032">That's a great question! And, of course, the Great leader has an answer for you. Open the book of quotations to the “Murders” section, to the chapter on “Murder of Relatives”. Let's read it aloud, “Losing a loved one is a misfortune; losing faith in our party is a tragedy”.</string>
  <string id="8033">And what does that mean?</string>
  <string id="8034">It means you're asking the wrong questions! Think of how to help the Leader! Join us! Help the Leader make the world better!</string>
  <string id="8035">Why did my colleague, George Hemnitz, get punished?</string>
  <string id="8036">Great question! Punishment is a gift from the Leader to point us towards the right path! There is a whole chapter on punishments in the Leader's book of quotations, and it explains everything! Take this, for example, “Public hanging is a great honor, for the punished one gives hope for tomorrow to the living!”.</string>
  <string id="8037">I doubt Hemnitz was excited about being honored that much.</string>
  <string id="8038">Not everyone can accept the Leader's wisdom. Come, and we'll teach you to see it everywhere!</string>
  <string id="8039">Where can I get some money?</string>
  <string id="8040">Great question! Everyone keeps asking, and only the Leader has the answer!</string>
  <string id="8041">What is the answer?!</string>
  <string id="8042">See the Leader's book of quotations, page 59, third paragraph down: “Don't ask me where to get money!”. Brilliant, isn't it?</string>
  <string id="8043">What's the point of living?</string>
  <string id="8044">That's a terrific question! Tell me honestly, have you already tried to find the answer elsewhere? Books, films, plays? A philosopher friend, perhaps?</string>
  <string id="8045">Philosophers are enemies of people! I don't have friends like that!</string>
  <string id="8046">Just checking. Bear with me, I’m just doing my job. So, the only place to find the answer is in the Leader's writings. Want to know more?</string>

  <string id="10487">Of course, Comrade Redgrave! Where do you need it delivered?</string>
  <string id="10488">I think this is for you personally.</string>

  <string id="10491">What statue… Ah! Oh!</string>
  <string id="10492">Keep your voice down, Nicholas!</string>
  <string id="10493">Sorry... I get it! Do you have anything else?</string>
  <string id="10494">Here, take this.</string>
  <string id="10495">Excellent! So the time has come...</string>
  <string id="10496">Well... something like that, yes. Where do I get my money?</string>
  <string id="10497">This’s not a question for me, Comrade Redgrave! Long live The New Tomorrow!</string>

  <string id="11791">So you haven’t heard anything at all?</string>
  <string id="11792">Everyone envies him. The boss is a big shot, and girls like him.</string>
  <string id="11793">While I roll the document cart back and forth, he rolls in his private car with the Ministry's young female employees! Do you know many people who own a private car?</string>

  <string id="8587">Well… I… Err...</string>
  <string id="8588">What are you mumbling about? Speak faster, I need to help a new employee figure out her terminal. She has no idea what to do.</string>

  <string id="8590">If there were more people like you, the world would be a better place!</string>
  <string id="8591">Oh, come on! I'm just an ordinary girl! Work, home - nothing interesting!</string>
  <string id="8592">What do you do in your free time?</string>
  <string id="8593">If only I had any! But I do I watch TV shows when I get the chance, or sometimes go to the park or the library. What about you?</string>
  <string id="8594">Tell her she's wasting her time</string>
  <string id="8595">You're wasting your time! Nobody will pay you for that!</string>
  <string id="8596">Well, I like to help people. Not everything in the world is measured in money!</string>
  <string id="8597">Of course, of course, don't get mad!</string>

  <string id="8602">I like watching The Passion of the Leader. I also like going for walks and reading books.</string>
  <string id="8603">That’s my favorite show! I wish I had a close-knit family like that, with lots of children running around! Well, at least two... Both boys. One of them would have a birthmark right here, but we could always have it removed.</string>
  <string id="8604">Talk about yourself honestly</string>
  <string id="8605">I'm afraid of beetles, open spaces, and the idea of everyone laughing at me.</string>
  <string id="8606">Hm... Valuable information! Are you always so frank or am I just lucky?</string>
  <string id="8607">Mom always told me to speak only the truth.</string>
  <string id="8608">How sweet! Do you still live with your mother? Do you have a family, children?</string>
  <string id="8609">Tell her you love children</string>
  <string id="8610">I adore children. Although I haven't found the right person to have them with yet...</string>
  <string id="8611">Really? What an incredible coincidence! Children are so cute, so wonderful! But you’re right, it’s very difficult to find the right person...</string>
  <string id="8612">Tell her you don't like children</string>
  <string id="8613">I hate children. They scream constantly, always make a mess and don't know how to behave!</string>
  <string id="8614">But children are our future!</string>
  <string id="8615">Our future is the victory of the Leader's great cause!</string>
  <string id="8616">Of course! But children are a miracle! It's a pity that so few people are fit to be good parents...</string>

  <string id="9186">And if a department loses? Does everyone in it get fined?</string>
  <string id="9187">My son was just as inquisitive when he was little. I used to tell him, “You’ll find everything out in good time!” The final is tomorrow. Just wait a little and you’ll get answers to all your questions!</string>

  <string id="9195">Well nobody else does either, but what can you do? The clock’s ticking! You don’t get awards for doing nothing!</string>

  <string id="9217">What does he do?</string>

  <string id="9219">My son is the only family I have! My only pride and joy!</string>
  <string id="9220">He’s a famous pianist! The Leader himself applauded him at the Labor Day concert. He is constantly on tour around the country; I worry about him.</string>
  <string id="9221">Why do you worry?</string>
  <string id="9222">Why indeed! Famous artists attract all kinds of groupies. I’m afraid that some fangirl will get her claws into him!</string>

  <string id="9247">Gloria, did you sign your son up for the patriotic quiz? Rose said he didn’t come to the practice run.</string>
  <string id="9248">My son is a famous cellist, so, as the leading breeder of new varieties of potato, he had to attend a meeting of the City Zoo Ethics Committee. So naturally, he couldn’t make it!</string>
  <string id="9249">Why sign him up then?</string>
  <string id="9250">Oh, don’t ask me! This day has been so hectic, my head is spinning!</string>
  <string id="9251">Gloria, hi! You mention your son quite a lot... Could you tell me more about him? I'm very interested.</string>
  <string id="9252">Of course! I could talk about him for hours! What would you like to know?</string>
  <string id="9253">Ask about school</string>
  <string id="9254">What school is he at?</string>
  <string id="9255">My boy is so smart that he skipped every grade and went straight to college! He graduated high school with honors, only I can’t put my finger on which school it was now. It was either Military No. 8948 or Astronomy No. 22033. It made me so happy!</string>
  <string id="9257">-&gt;$9256</string>
  <string id="9258">Ask about favorite book</string>
  <string id="9259">Does he like reading? What’s his favorite book?</string>
  <string id="9260">Not sure what it is now, some reference book or other. But as a kid he loved a graphic novel about the adventures of someone called “Cast-Iron Man”.</string>
  <string id="9261">Graphic novel? You mean like a comic book?</string>
  <string id="9262">Graphic! Novel! My son doesn’t read those silly comic books!</string>
  <string id="9263">Ask about favorite sport</string>
  <string id="9264">Is he into sports?</string>
  <string id="9265">Of course - he cares about his health. Now it’s all rowing and competitive checkers with him. He even has official rankings in tactical chess and open field hide-and-seek! I'm so proud of him!</string>
  <string id="9266">Ask about free time</string>
  <string id="9267">What does he do for fun? He probably doesn’t even have the time to take a stroll.</string>
  <string id="9268">Why do you say that? He’s very fond of walking! He can stroll up and down the embankment for hours. He says that it’s the best place for mulling over new ideas! You know, my boy is a brilliant physicist; he likes to look at the water, it soothes him!</string>
  <string id="9269">Hello, Gloria. Can we talk?</string>
  <string id="9270">Yes, of course. What happened?</string>
  <string id="9271">Well, the thing is... I wanted to meet your son, so I made some inquiries...</string>
  <string id="9272">What for?! I would have introduced you myself! I mean, he’s very busy, so I’m not sure he would have found time, but there was no need to go asking anyone...</string>
  <string id="9273">Gloria, I know your son died 5 years ago.</string>
  <string id="9274">What? Don’t be silly... My son is alive!</string>
  <string id="9275">No, Gloria. Dr. Binet told me everything... About Malcolm and your illness... You should start taking your medication again.</string>
  <string id="9276">Gloria?</string>
  <string id="9277">Malcolm is... dead?.. But... what about me?</string>
  <string id="9278">I’m so sorry...</string>
  <string id="9279">What am I going to do, Evan?.. I... I can’t live without him...</string>
  <string id="9280">You should get back into treatment, Gloria!</string>
  <string id="9281">Why? Why should I get treatment if Malcolm is gone? Tell me, Evan, why do I need all this?</string>
  <string id="9282">Gloria, I...</string>
  <string id="9283">WHY? I... I don’t want it!</string>
  <string id="9284">Listen!</string>
  <string id="9285">I! Don’t! Want it!</string>
  <string id="9286">Gloria, wait! Where are you going...</string>
  <string id="9287">That was a very, very, very bad joke, Evan! I didn’t think you were capable of something like this. Never do such a thing to me or anyone else again!</string>
  <string id="9288">Hi, mom! How are you?</string>
  <string id="9289">Malcolm, is that you? What a surprise! What are you doing here? How did you get in?</string>
  <string id="9290">I asked a policeman where I could find you and told him who I was, and he let me through. Great, isn’t it? Now I can finally see what you do here!</string>
  <string id="9291">Malcolm, I’m so happy! Come on, I’ll show you everything!</string>
  <string id="9292">Look what a beautiful Shredder we have here, Malcolm! It works around the clock, disposing of the spoiled and processed applications.</string>
  <string id="9293">Wow! I’ve never seen anything like it!</string>
  <string id="9294">Didn’t they teach you about it in Bureaucracy class?</string>
  <string id="9295">They did, but it’s much more interesting to see it in person!</string>
  <string id="9296">But they collected money for a tour around the Ministry, they were supposed to show you everything!</string>
  <string id="9297">Well, mom, you know how it works... They took the tour money and sent us on a field trip to dig turnips.</string>
  <string id="9298">What?! I had no idea! I will file a complaint! Remind me, what was the number of your school?</string>
  <string id="9299">School No. 6056</string>
  <string id="9300">How could you forget? Remember how we laughed when we noticed that it’s made up of grandpa’s age and your year of birth?</string>
  <string id="9301">That can’t be right... Your grandfather died at 25, and I'm not that old!</string>
  <string id="9302">School No. 2562</string>
  <string id="9303">2562. You used to know those numbers by heart! You said that was exactly how much you had to pay the principal to get me a place.</string>
  <string id="9304">Do you have a fever, darling? What are you talking about? I never bribed anyone!</string>
  <string id="9305">School No. 0261</string>
  <string id="9306">0261, I think. What do you mean, you had no idea? Don’t you remember how those turnips saved us from starving?</string>
  <string id="9307">Sorry, son... Of course I remember! It’s just my memory isn’t as good as it used to be.</string>
  <string id="9308">It’s alright, mom. I’m just glad everything is okay now.</string>
  <string id="9309">You know what, let’s go to the movies after work, like we used to!</string>
  <string id="9310">They’re all about war now, and I don’t like those...</string>
  <string id="9311">We can try and find a civilian show! Do you remember what your favorite movie was as a kid? We must have watched it a hundred times, at least!</string>
  <string id="9312">Attack of the Killer Turnips</string>
  <string id="9313">Turnips? You couldn’t even look at them after that winter when we had nothing else to eat! Do you need to go get some fresh air?</string>
  <string id="9314">The Human Caterpillar</string>
  <string id="9315">Malcolm, I'm talking about when you were a child! The Human Caterpillar is a film for adults... You couldn’t have seen it back then! Maybe you really should go get some air.</string>
  <string id="9316">Pride and Prejudice and the Leader</string>
  <string id="9317">Right! You were in love with the main character! You used to hide a picture of her under your pillow and stare at it at night.</string>
  <string id="9318">Mom, don’t...</string>
  <string id="9319">It’s alright, Malcolm, all boys are the same at that age. You’ll see when you have kids of your own. I hope I’ll still be around to tell them funny stories about their dad!</string>
  <string id="9320">The Sneaky Snitch</string>
  <string id="9321">That’s strange...</string>
  <string id="9322">What’s strange, mom?</string>
  <string id="9323">It’s strange that you forgot what your own favorite movie is, and now you're lying to my face about it.</string>
  <string id="9324">I’m not lying! It was definitely “Snitch”!</string>
  <string id="9325">The Sneaky Snitch came out three years ago. How could you have watched it as a child? I think we need to have a serious talk about your behavior!</string>
  <string id="9326">Speaking of movies... Remember when you left your favorite book in the movie theater? We spent such a long time searching for it that we were arrested for violating the curfew! I can’t remember the title...</string>
  <string id="9327">Advice for a Young Partisan</string>
  <string id="9328">Malcolm, are you feeling alright?</string>
  <string id="9329">Yes, why?</string>
  <string id="9330">I think you’re delusional! We’ve never had books like that at home! It’s against the law!</string>
  <string id="9331">The Extraordinary Adventures of Cast-Iron Man</string>
  <string id="9332">Yes, that’s it! Remember his catchphrase? “Cast iron is heavy... but brittle!”</string>
  <string id="9333">Why did you bring it up?</string>
  <string id="9334">I don’t know, I just remembered it...</string>
  <string id="9335">The Great Quotes of the Wise Leader</string>
  <string id="9336">Malcolm, your mother is not old enough just yet to forget the title of your favorite book... And that one has never been your favorite, because it doesn’t have any pictures.</string>
  <string id="9337">The Farm and Things That Grow There</string>
  <string id="9338">What farm? You hate digging around in the dirt! You’ve changed a lot over the years, Malcolm - you never lied to me before!</string>
  <string id="9339">Actually, it’s a pity we see each other so rarely these days. When you were little, we used to take the longest walks and you told me about all kinds of things...</string>
  <string id="9340">That was so long ago!</string>
  <string id="9341">One time you caught a glimpse of the sunset through the smog, and said that now it would be your favorite place to go walking! Do you remember where it was?</string>
  <string id="9342">On the embankment</string>
  <string id="9343">Right! Even though we later found out that the sunset was actually the reflection of a warehouse fire, it was beautiful. I remember every moment!</string>
  <string id="9344">At the railway station</string>
  <string id="9345">Are you talking nonsense on purpose? So that I don’t burst into tears at the memory of it? Don’t, Malcolm, I can control myself! You underestimate me!</string>
  <string id="9346">At Pesticide subway station</string>
  <string id="9347">Honey, you’re head is a mess just like it was before! How could you have seen the sunset underground?</string>
  <string id="9348">At the Young Patriot Amusement Park</string>
  <string id="9349">Malcolm, there is no such park in our city, you’re making things up again.</string>
  <string id="9350">Gloria, I think we should stop this!</string>
  <string id="9351">Malcolm, why are you calling me by my name? I’m your mother!</string>
  <string id="9352">Gloria! Look at me! I’m not Malcolm, I’m Evan! I'm sorry I had to lie, but I was worried about your health!</string>
  <string id="9353">Evan? But... Wait a minute! You really are Evan! But where is Malcolm? He was right here!</string>
  <string id="9354">Gloria! Malcolm wasn’t here...</string>
  <string id="9355">What do you mean? He was here, he was here! He was... my son...</string>
  <string id="9356">Come on, try to remember!</string>
  <string id="9357">A car crash... I remember a car crash... Oh no! I remember now... Malcolm died in the crash, and I survived...</string>
  <string id="9358">I’m so sorry, Gloria.</string>
  <string id="9359">It’s all so fuzzy... I felt so much pain... I... Was I in hospital? I remember doctors!</string>
  <string id="9360">Yes, Gloria, you were in hospital. You were treated by the best doctors. You saw things that weren’t there, like you’re seeing now, but you were cured and even came back to work!</string>
  <string id="9361">But I saw Malcolm as clear as I see you now! Oh my God... Has it started again?</string>
  <string id="9362">Gloria, you need to start with your treatment again!</string>
  <string id="9363">So that’s why everyone was looking at me like I was crazy! That’s why I couldn’t contact my son... It feels like I can see things clearly again! Evan, I need to be readmitted into hospital...</string>
  <string id="9364">You’ve made the right decision, Gloria! I’m happy for you.</string>
  <string id="9368">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="9369">Thank you, Gloria! You shouldn’t have...</string>
  <string id="9370">Oh, I should! Thanks again. I’ll go call Dr. Binet, maybe he has a place for me on his ward...</string>
  <string id="9371">Good luck, Gloria. Get well!</string>
  <string id="9372">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="9373">I’m sorry Gloria, but I can’t accept it. Don’t make me.</string>
  <string id="9374">You have a big heart, Evan Redgrave! It’s a pity there aren’t more people like you out there! I’ll go call Dr. Binet, maybe he has a place for me on his ward...</string>
  <string id="9375">Good luck to you, Gloria. Get well!</string>
  <string id="9376">Wait... You’re not my son! You’re not Malcolm! Who are you?</string>
  <string id="9377">Finally, you’ve come to your senses! I’m your colleague Evan!</string>
  <string id="9378">But why did you pretend to be my son?</string>
  <string id="9379">Justify yourself</string>
  <string id="9380">I had to! You were having hallucinations!</string>
  <string id="9381">What are you talking about, what hallucinations? Do you think I’m crazy?</string>
  <string id="9382">Well... sort of, yes!</string>
  <string id="9383">WHAT?! I’ve never been so insulted! I’m going to tell Malcolm - he’s the middleweight boxing world champion, I’ll have you know! He’ll beat you to a pulp, you scoundrel! Do not come near me any more!</string>
  <string id="9384">Young man, there is no excuse for this kind of childish talk! You should learn to take responsibility for your actions!</string>
  <string id="9386">-&gt;$9385</string>
  <string id="9387">Because I’m fed up with your “my son this, my son that”!</string>
  <string id="9389">-&gt;$9388</string>
  <string id="9390">You heard me! I’ve had it up to here with you and your damn Malcolm! I can’t take one step without you yapping on about him!</string>
  <string id="9391">“Damn Malcolm”? Mock me all you want, but I will not let anyone insult my son!</string>
  <string id="9392">What are you going to do? Ground me?</string>
  <string id="9393">You’ll see!</string>
  <string id="9394">We’ll talk later.</string>
  <string id="9395">Get back to work!</string>
  <string id="10327">There’s nothing to be happy about, Evan. I’m so confused...</string>
  <string id="10328">You helped me and I want to thank you. I have some money that I was saving as a gift for my son. I want you to take it.</string>
  <string id="10329">Gloria, do you remember Rabindranath Wright? He worked here before I came.</string>
  <string id="10330">Of course, he's Hank's brother. But I haven't seen him in a long time.</string>
  <string id="10331">Tell me about him.</string>
  <string id="10332">Well, he was pretty ordinary... Didn't stand out. He was always joking with his brother. Worked fine. Then he stopped coming to work. I assumed he got sick or got transferred.</string>
  <string id="10333">Hank mentioned something about that, but I had my own problems at the time. And then he started drinking and getting rude.</string>
  <string id="10335">-&gt;$10334</string>
  <string id="10336">Hmm. A little while before he disappeared, Rabindranath got an award for exceeding the appeals recycling quota. He was summoned to the boss’s office.</string>
  <string id="10337">Thanks, Gloria.</string>
  <string id="12203">How are you, Gloria?</string>
  <string id="12204">Better already, Evan! Thank you. I can imagine how unpleasant it was for you to talk to a crazy woman...</string>
  <string id="12205">No, not at all! You're not...</string>
  <string id="12206">Crazy, Evan, crazy... A crazy old woman with dreams of a non-existent son... But that's all in the past!</string>
  <string id="12207">Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="12208">Yes, of course. They’re already waiting for me at the hospital. I’ll get some rest, undergo treatment then come back to work.</string>
  <string id="12209">I'm sure everything will be alright.</string>
  <string id="12210">I hope so! After everything that happened, I’m not sure anymore. I just hope this doesn’t happen again... Anyway, thank you.</string>
  <string id="12211">You're welcome, Gloria. Get well soon!</string>
  <string id="12212">Thanks for helping, Evan!</string>
  <string id="9396">Hello, my name is Evan!</string>
  <string id="9397">Oh hi, Evan! I’m Arthur Mitchell, the janitor. It’s my first day here.</string>
  <string id="9398">What happened to your face? Where did you get those bruises?</string>
  <string id="9399">That noticeable, huh? My pals and I had some drinks yesterday to celebrate my new job. They got me so liquored up I don’t remember how I got home.</string>
  <string id="9400">Some friends you have. They could have helped!</string>
  <string id="9401">Ah, it’s nothing! I probably tripped on the way back... Or stumbled into a police patrol... Or maybe I got into a fight - my jaw is killing me and I’ve got a couple of teeth missing.</string>
  <string id="9402">You probably shouldn’t drink so much.</string>
  <string id="9403">It’ll be okay in time for the wedding! The main thing is that the boss doesn’t notice. I'm going to clean his office tonight. Can you imagine what an honor that is? On the first day, no less!</string>
  <string id="9404">Hi, Arthur!</string>
  <string id="9405">Oh, hi! How did you know my name?</string>
  <string id="9406">It’s me, Evan! We’ve already met!</string>
  <string id="9407">Ah, I see! You must have been in the bar yesterday when I was with my pals. Did you happen to see who tanned my hide so bad? How am I going to clean the boss’s office tonight? And it’s my first day, no less!</string>
  <string id="9409">Oh, hi! You know my name?</string>
  <string id="9410">Yes, your name is Arthur, you’re a janitor, it’s your first day here and this evening you’re going to the boss’s office. My name is Evan.</string>
  <string id="9411">Are you from the personnel department, or what? How do you know all this? Ah, who cares? Hello, Evan!</string>

  <string id="9414">-&gt;$9413</string>
  <string id="9415">I know you’re also new here, but maybe you know what this Supergame is all about?</string>
  <string id="9416">No idea! Chess or checkers, I guess... Personally, I’m only into drinking games.</string>
  <string id="9418">Did you see what happened today? They went and fed a bunch of people to the Shredder! What kind of Supergame is it, where people end up shredded like cabbage?</string>
  <string id="9419">I’m shocked myself! I’m supposed to clean up the whole mess afterwards! And on my first day to boot! They could have at least given me an assistant!</string>
  <string id="9420">Assistant? I’m telling you that people were turned into mincemeat because of some stupid game!</string>
  <string id="9421">How’s that my business? I don’t play games like that, so I don’t care. If the losers can’t handle the grind, then the grind will handle them. Get it? You can’t put the mincemeat back in the tube, as they say.</string>
  <string id="9423">-&gt;$9422</string>
  <string id="9424">Have you seen the Shredder? What do you think of it?</string>
  <string id="9425">Terrible thing, I tell ya... All those blades, ugh! Everything is swimming in front of my eyes after yesterday... I’ve gotta get a grip before I fall over!</string>

  <string id="9429">You said your face will be okay in time for the wedding. Is there actually a story behind that or are you single?</string>
  <string id="9430">I had a girlfriend, but turns out she’s a bitch. We just broke up today.</string>
  <string id="9431">How come?</string>
  <string id="9432">I went to her place this morning and there were two children and this dude, like, a husband there. Never been kissed, she told me!</string>

  <string id="11065">Hello, Arthur! Rose said you had the key to my work booth.</string>
  <string id="11066">What? What key, what Rose, who are you?</string>
  <string id="11067">I'm Evan, I work here. We’ve already met. So do you have the key to my booth?</string>
  <string id="11068">Key? Oh, right! I found it in my pocket today! I was wondering where it came from…</string>

  <string id="9449">Hi. I’m Otto, Otto Werner. What’s your allegiance?</string>
  <string id="9450">Allegiance? What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="9451">Well, do you shuffle papers around or can you do stuff with your hands?</string>
  <string id="9452">Papers, actually, but I can also do things with my hands...</string>
  <string id="9453">Oh you can, can you? Well, I’m a grade-6 technician, so if I see your hands anywhere near my sweetie-pie I’ll feed you to her personally.</string>
  <string id="9454">Are you talking about the Shredder?</string>
  <string id="9455">“Shredder”?! Get outta here with your talk like that. This machine is the best thing in the friggin’ Ministry!</string>
  <string id="9456">Aren’t you afraid of saying things like that?</string>
  <string id="9457">What do I have to be afraid of? I’ve overhauled this so-called “Shredder” twice with my eyes closed, and I know it like the back of my three-fingered hand! Where could they find another mechanic like me?</string>
  <string id="9461">-&gt;$9460</string>

  <string id="9467">Can you tell me about the Shred... your sweetie-pie?</string>
  <string id="9468">Ooh! She’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen! There’s no other like her in the whole world! It took 1,000 engineers to put her together! She takes up three floors! Got a processing speed of ten tons a minute! Self-sharpening blades, and enough power to grind metal and stone!</string>
  <string id="9469">Have you tried?</string>
  <string id="9470">When I was younger, sure... Kept trying to find something too tough for her to chew up.</string>
  <string id="9471">And did you find anything?</string>
  <string id="9472">What I found was my one true love! Nothing can stop my sweetie-pie when she gets going!</string>

  <string id="9474">Otto, have you heard about the inter-department competition?</string>
  <string id="9475">You office rats have nothing better to do, so you keep coming up with nonsense like that!</string>
  <string id="9476">But have you heard of it?</string>
  <string id="9477">I have no idea what the competition is about! To see who can shuffle the most papers around or something. I only know that I have to clean my sweetie-pie after every game! They toss stuff into her and I’m left to clear up the mess!</string>

  <string id="9490">Why do you think so?</string>
  <string id="9491">Look at me. Do I look like a boy? Old enough at least to be her husband, even though she's not my type... but a son? She’s clearly not in her right mind!</string>

  <string id="9494">What can you tell me about Hank?</string>

  <string id="9503">Just to see who wins. Rose is as hard as rock! She’ll devour anyone for that Supergame of hers without batting an eye. I’ve seen all sorts of horrors, but that witch causes me to come out in goosebumps... and drop a crowbar, as it were.</string>
  <string id="9504">Is there no way to reign her in?</string>
  <string id="9505">She only listens to the boss - everyone else means nothing to her. We’re just numbers on a scoreboard.</string>
  <string id="9507">Do you know anything about the boss?</string>
  <string id="9508">Listen, I’m a mechanic! As far as I’m concerned, the farther I am from the superiors, the better. The deal is, he doesn’t mess around here, I don’t mess around in his office. End of story!</string>

  <string id="9514">I have a question, Otto. Do you remember Rabindranath Wright, Hank’s brother?</string>
  <string id="9515">Rabindra nathrite anksbrother... what language are you speaking right now?</string>
  <string id="9516">The brother of the guy who visits your sweetie-pie every day and cries.</string>
  <string id="9517">He had a brother? I never would’ve guessed.</string>
  <string id="9518">Well, and he thinks his brother fell in...</string>
  <string id="9519">Go on! He fell into my sweetie-pie?</string>
  <string id="9520">Well, yes.</string>
  <string id="9521">What can I say? It happens. To those who do not comply with safety regulations, and I don’t want to answer for those fools. That’s why sweetie-pie here has a memory unit which logs everything that goes into her.</string>
  <string id="9522">Wow! Can I see the data on the unit?</string>
  <string id="9523">If you got me a replacement, I’d be able to take out the current one.</string>
  <string id="9524">Where can I get one of these memory units?</string>
  <string id="9525">Therein lies the challenge, soldier! You think you can just waltz in and get everything you want, just like that? Search for it!</string>

  <string id="11572">Ask why colleagues don't talk about him</string>
  <string id="11573">Otto, why does no one know anything about you?</string>
  <string id="11574">So your colleagues don't want to talk about me? They’re afraid of me. They believe everyone I talk to ends up losing the Supergame.</string>
  <string id="11575">And I have some old scores to settle with Rose Everdeen. That bitch refused to give me sick leave when I hurt my hand. I swore that she’d go the same way as my fingers, ha ha ha!</string>

  <string id="14869">Hank? He's probably sober, so he's angry. He'll get friendlier once he gets drinking.</string>
  <string id="15146">-&gt;$6106</string>
  <string id="9553">And just who are you?</string>
  <string id="9554">Introduce yourself</string>
  <string id="9555">Evan Redgrave. I’ve been assigned here by the Ministry of Distribution.</string>
  <string id="9556">Redgrave? Caleb’s kid?</string>
  <string id="9557">You knew my father?</string>
  <string id="9558">Of course I did. He was... uh... my best friend!</string>
  <string id="9560">-&gt;$9559</string>
  <string id="9562">-&gt;$9561</string>
  <string id="9563">-&gt;$6638</string>
  <string id="9564">Speak.</string>
  <string id="9565">Report on the bribe</string>
  <string id="9566">Give the collected money</string>
  <string id="9567">Discuss party preparations</string>
  <string id="9568">Talk about the safe robbery</string>
  <string id="9569">-&gt;$6265</string>
  <string id="9570">You sent for me, Comrade Ferguson?</string>
  <string id="9571">Who is it? Redgrave? You expect me to sit on my ass waiting all day? What took you so damn long?</string>
  <string id="9572">I was...</string>
  <string id="9573">Did I say you could speak? Shut up and listen! I agreed to take you on board here because your father trusted me and asked me to help you out. Now it’s time to return the favor. Get the picture?</string>
  <string id="9574">I don’t really understand what you’re...</string>
  <string id="9575">I’m sure you don’t! Your father was the sharp one, and I see that the apple of intelligence fell far from the tree in your case. So here’s the short version: you owe me.</string>
  <string id="9577">-&gt;$9576</string>
  <string id="9578">Heh, you catch on quick. You owe me for life! But to start, I want you to pretend to be a visitor to the Ministry. One of those bastards sitting in the hall has been stealing my money. Do you see?</string>
  <string id="9579">-&gt;$8887</string>
  <string id="9580">Are you a complete idiot? I’m saying that one of those pricks in the hall is pocketing the money that the visitors give. You do know that all bribes have to be given over into the government revenue, don’t you?</string>
  <string id="9581">-&gt;$8047</string>
  <string id="9582">And in your case, the government is me. And some rat is stealing from me. Our block-headed security guards can’t catch him, so I’ve come up with an ingenious operation that I call “Secret Visitor”. You’ve got a forgettable face, so you can pass for a common visitor. I want you to give him an envelope, and I’ll see if he gives me the money.</string>
  <string id="9583">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="9584">Understood, Comrade Ferguson! Is that all, sir?</string>
  <string id="9585">Did you really get all that on your first try? Get the fake money from my courier. There’ll be a guard waiting for you by the vending machine - he’ll fill you in on the rest. Report back as soon as you’re done. I don’t want to see you otherwise. Do you understand, Redgrave?</string>
  <string id="9586">Completely, sir!</string>
  <string id="9587">Then that’s all. Get the hell out of here!</string>
  <string id="9588">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="9589">I won’t spy on my colleagues... I’m not a scumbag like that.</string>
  <string id="9590">So you’re saying that I am?! You just made your last mistake! Guards!</string>
  <string id="9591">Permission to report in, Comrade Ferguson? I’ve completed your mission!</string>
  <string id="9592">Excellent. Now if this wiseguy doesn’t give me every last penny, he’s toast!</string>
  <string id="9593">It’s a woman...</string>
  <string id="9594">Gender has no bearing on professional character, Evan Redgrave!</string>
  <string id="9595">You’ve shown me that you’re not a complete imbecile like the rest of them. Your next job is to go to the office, collect money and bring it back to me.</string>
  <string id="9596">-&gt;$14497</string>
  <string id="9597">How slow can you be?! Government money, Redgrave! The money our moronic visitors give to our idiotic co-workers for the good of our great country.</string>
  <string id="9598">Your colleagues already know how much they owe me. And if they forget, Rakovich will remind them.</string>
  <string id="9599">Alright, I’ll do it!</string>
  <string id="9600">That’s the right answer. To the rear, march! And close the door behind you!</string>
  <string id="9601">You know, I don’t like this idea.</string>
  <string id="9602">It’s an order, Redgrave. Or have you already forgotten what happened to Hemnitz?</string>
  <string id="9604">-&gt;$9603</string>
  <string id="9605">I haven’t forgotten. I’m sorry, I was wrong.</string>
  <string id="9606">That’s more like it! Speak up like that again and there’ll be consequences.</string>
  <string id="9607">Hemnitz was an honest man, unlike you. I won’t collect your bribes, Ferguson!</string>
  <string id="9608">Insubordination! Dissidence! I’ll pulverize you! Guards!</string>
  <string id="9609">About your task, boss...</string>
  <string id="9610">Did you get lost in the bathroom or something? Where’s my money? I mean, the state’s money.</string>
  <string id="9611">Give the money</string>
  <string id="9612">That’s all of it.</string>
  <string id="9613">Great! I do love round numbers! Give it here and let’s talk.</string>
  <string id="9614">Give fake money</string>
  <string id="9615">Say that you haven’t collected the money yet</string>
  <string id="9616">I need a little more time.</string>
  <string id="9617">Imbecile! I told you not to come back here without the money!</string>
  <string id="9618">You’re trying my patience, Redgrave! And you don’t want to see me in a bad mood!</string>
  <string id="9619">Do you think that we bosses have it easy, Redgrave? Not at all! That’s some small-minded thinking!</string>
  <string id="9620">Don’t look at me like that! We’re just people like you. Better than you, of course. But like you.</string>
  <string id="9621">And y’know, everyone needs to have a bit of fun sometimes. Nothing fancy - some wings, some hot dogs, the strongest moonshine you can get your hands on...</string>
  <string id="9622">I’ve got enough “fancy” booze. Enough to get the whole Ministry good and merry. But I could do with something simpler, something more salt-of-the-earth...</string>
  <string id="9623">Why are you just sitting there, looking at me like a schoolgirl admiring the Leader?! Is there something you’re not understanding? Your boss wants to have a good time! Make it happen!</string>
  <string id="9624">Agree to organize party</string>
  <string id="9625">Understood, Comrade Ferguson! As you wish!</string>
  <string id="9626">Damn straight. What are you still standing around for? Get out of my sight!</string>
  <string id="9627">Refuse to organize party</string>
  <string id="9628">But Comrade Ferguson! The Ministry’s by-laws prohibit drinking in the workplace. I could lose my job if anyone catches me.</string>
  <string id="9629">And you’ll definitely lose your job if you don’t follow my orders!</string>
  <string id="9630">My apologies. It’ll be done to the highest standard!</string>
  <string id="9631">Get a move on!</string>
  <string id="9632">I’m sorry, but I can’t break the law.</string>
  <string id="9633">I’ve had enough of you. Guards!</string>
  <string id="9634">Redgrave! Where have you been, damn it! Have you carried out my orders!</string>
  <string id="9635">Yes, Comrade Ferguson! Everything’s ready. Only the best, the freshest and the least-fancy, just as you ordered!</string>
  <string id="9636">Excellent! And... find me a couple of girls, too. And make sure they’re... “open-minded”, let’s say...</string>
  <string id="9637">-&gt;$7476</string>
  <string id="9638">You need to have balance - you’ve got to relax your body as well as your mind! How about this: get one leggy blonde, a natural one, like one of those models from the House of Patriotic Fashion. And the other one - exactly the opposite. A nice chubby one, so there’s something to hold on to.</string>
  <string id="9639">Almost ready, Comrade Ferguson.</string>
  <string id="9640">I’m losing my patience, Redgrave!</string>
  <string id="9641">It’s not complicated, you moron! Get a move on!</string>
  <string id="9642">Hop to it if you want to keep your job!</string>
  <string id="9643">Comrade Ferguson...</string>
  <string id="9644">I know my own name, get to the point! Have you done what I asked?</string>
  <string id="9645">-&gt;$6277</string>
  <string id="9646">Yes sir! I’ve found a pair of beauties, just as requested! They can’t wait to meet you!</string>
  <string id="9647">Well they’re only human. This might just be their lucky day. I can be quite kind once I’ve eaten.</string>
  <string id="9648">-&gt;$6705</string>
  <string id="9649">There have been some difficulties, Comrade Ferguson...</string>
  <string id="9651">Give up Peter Dong</string>
  <string id="9652">It was Peter Dong.</string>
  <string id="9653">Are you sure? He’s a certified idiot, but an honest one.</string>
  <string id="9654">I’m absolutely sure. He could do it for his mother. He even asked me to join him.</string>
  <string id="9655">How dare he make a mockery of my safe! Of the Motherland! Of the Leader Himself! Does he think he’s invincible?</string>
  <string id="9656">Admit to the robbery</string>
  <string id="9657">It was me. But...</string>
  <string id="9658">I can’t believe you’re so stupid that you’d rat yourself out...</string>
  <string id="9659">Don’t waste any more of my time.</string>
  <string id="9660">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="9661">My reports file won’t even close anymore, everyone’s blaming each other - the idiots! Everyone here has shit for brains... Shit for brains!</string>
  <string id="9662">Why aren’t you working?</string>
  <string id="9766">Is this a joke, Redgrave?</string>
  <string id="9768">I took the bonds so that you could make some money off of fines for their disappearance.</string>
  <string id="9769">Indeed... I’ve earned even more that the bonds were worth.</string>
  <string id="9770">Great job! I admire your attitude.</string>
  <string id="10036">I cannot believe that I welcomed a traitor into my loving bosom! I’ll tear them apart when I find them!</string>
  <string id="10037">What happened?</string>
  <string id="10038">Someone took advantage of the fact that the cameras in my office were off, and broke into my safe! Do you know who cleaned me out?</string>
  <string id="10039">Are you sure? He was a certified idiot, but an honest one.</string>
  <string id="10040">Absolutely. He’s capable of anything when it’s for his mother! Was capable... He even asked me to be his accomplice.</string>
  <string id="10041">That little shit stain! Hiding from me in his grave!</string>
  <string id="10042">Convince him you’re innocent</string>
  <string id="10043">I’m not convinced.</string>
  <string id="10044">Confess and give up the bonds</string>
  <string id="10045">Here are your securities, I’ll explain everything...</string>
  <string id="10046">Confess</string>
  <string id="10047">It’s not a joke, I’ll explain everything...</string>
  <string id="10048">You called?</string>
  <string id="10049">Ah, Redgrave! What the hell do you think you’re doing?! Trading in drugs right under my nose!</string>
  <string id="10050">Legrand told me everything! What do you have to say for yourself?</string>
  <string id="10051">Convince him of the stimulants’ benefits</string>
  <string id="10052">Stimulants increase productivity. Workers can meet their quotas in half a day!</string>
  <string id="10053">So what do they do for the rest of the day? Layabouts!</string>
  <string id="10054">But you can double the workload...</string>
  <string id="10055">So they’ll work more for the same money? I admire your business acumen!</string>
  <string id="10056">Selling stimulants was Legrand’s idea.</string>
  <string id="10057">That dog thought he could fool me, Ferguson, and earn some cash!</string>
  <string id="10058">Well that’s that! I’ll take over the drug business and throw Legrand under the bus!</string>
  <string id="10059">Stop bullshitting me!</string>
  <string id="10060">Prove that selling stimulants is profitable</string>
  <string id="10061">Actually, it is very profitable! One hit costs as much as a wage bonus!</string>
  <string id="10062">And you didn’t turn the money over to the state?!</string>
  <string id="10063">I didn’t have the time, Comrade Ferguson! I’d only just figured out that there’s a demand when Legrand blew the whistle. Even though it was his idea!</string>
  <string id="10064">It’s good that there’s a demand. Very good. Fools need to be parted from their money!</string>
  <string id="10065">I have 60 people in line for every job, so we have the resources...</string>
  <string id="10066">So where is your “profit?”</string>
  <string id="10067">Accept the blame</string>
  <string id="10756">-&gt;$10755</string>
  <string id="10757">Ask about this floor</string>
  <string id="10758">Please tell me about this floor.</string>
  <string id="10759">Do I have nothing else to do?</string>
  <string id="10760">How does the first floor manage to meet all the quotas? After all, the get bigger and bigger all the time, but the number of employees doesn't change.</string>
  <string id="10761">The first floor? I'm the only one who does anything around here! I work my fingers to the bone while these layabouts lounge around in their booths!</string>
  <string id="10762">The first floor is the foundation of the whole Ministry. And I will prove that they can't manage without me!</string>
  <string id="10763">Manage what?</string>
  <string id="10764">None of your business!</string>
  <string id="10765">Or what talking head has replaced her?</string>
  <string id="10766">Everything is ready for the party - time to have fun! Are you ready to have fun, Redgrave?</string>
  <string id="10767">Yes, let's light the dance floor up!</string>
  <string id="10768">I was born ready, Comrade Ferguson.</string>
  <string id="10769">No, I’d better get some sleep</string>
  <string id="10770">I should go home and get some sleep. I have work tomorrow...</string>
  <string id="10771">You’re so boring, Redgrave.</string>
  <string id="10772">I’d give that shit-eater the beating of his life. He should be glad that he got off so easily.</string>
  <string id="10773">It's decided! I’ll take control of the drug thing and get rid of Legrand!</string>
  <string id="10774">Redgrave, you bastard, come here! I want to thank you!</string>
  <string id="10775">Thank you, Comrade Ferguson! What for?</string>
  <string id="10776">Not what for, but who from, Redgrave! From our mutual friends.</string>
  <string id="10777">I'm new here, Comrade Ferguson. I don’t have any friends in Helmer.</string>
  <string id="10778">You're wrong, Redgrave! I’m talking about the friends that blew up the new wing of the Ministry today! That was quite a bang! Razed the whole thing to the ground!</string>
  <string id="10779">Er... Comrade Ferguson... I... I had nothing to do with that...</string>
  <string id="10780">Don't mumble! I know everything! I'm Ferguson! Those friends have been helping me for years.</string>
  <string id="10781">Helping you? With what?</string>
  <string id="10782">With this, Redgrave! That wing will have to be rebuilt, right? Right! Will they need concrete and brick for it? Yes they will! And who is the Ministry’s sole supplier of bricks and concrete?</string>
  <string id="10783">-&gt;$10745</string>
  <string id="10784">“Ferguson &amp; Sons”! In other words - me!</string>
  <string id="10785">So the explosion was your idea? How could you do something like that?! They told me that there’d be no one in the wing - there were dozens of victims!</string>
  <string id="10786">Watch your tongue! I wasn’t the one who came up with it, it was those New Tomorrow terrorists. So what if a couple of office rats died? No bid deal. There's a long line of them at the Ministry of Labor! This will reduce the unemployment rate.</string>
  <string id="10787">But it’s... it’s...</string>
  <string id="10788">It’s profitable, Redgrave. You’ll see that for yourself when you check your bank account. And if you whine about it or tell anyone, you’ll regret it. Now get back to work!</string>
  <string id="11059">Comrade Ferguson, how did Operation “Secret Visitor” end?</string>
  <string id="11060">It ended with nothing. I was wrong to suspect that woman - she brought enough money.</string>
  <string id="11061">But that doesn't mean she isn’t guilty. I just don't know what to blame her for!</string>
  <string id="11062">We caught the thief! We caught one rat and sent a message to the others!</string>
  <string id="11685">Talk about the party</string>
  <string id="11686">Have yourself a good time yesterday, Redgrave? I shudder to remember it! It was amazing!</string>
  <string id="11687">Your father and I were friends, but he always avoided the pleasures of life. I think my friendship with his son will be a lot more fun, right, Evan?</string>
  <string id="11688">I didn't expect that from you, Redgrave! You spoiled my classy party with your stupid antics! Just like your father!</string>
  <string id="11689">Do you have no imagination at all? Where's your passion, your expression, your thirst for adventure?</string>
  <string id="11690">Well, there's nothing to do about that! Go work if you don't know how to have fun.</string>
  <string id="11691">Redgrave, where the hell were you? You missed all the fun!</string>
  <string id="11692">The party was wild, but you’re such a goddamn bore! If you only knew how I... Hmm...</string>
  <string id="11693">Anyway, get back to work and don't get distracted!</string>
  <string id="11058">Ask about the results of Operation “Secret Visitor”</string>
  <string id="15096">Talk about the recording from the party</string>
  <string id="15097">Comrade Ferguson, I have a recording of your party.</string>
  <string id="15098">-&gt;$8150</string>
  <string id="15099">I think this is enough to get you fired from the Ministry...</string>
  <string id="15100">WHAT?!</string>
  <string id="15101">-&gt;$14319</string>
  <string id="15102">I need money, Pete.</string>
  <string id="15103">Have you forgotten who you are, you little snot! Shit-eater! I will bury you! No one dares blackmail me! Security!</string>
  <string id="15104">Give the recording</string>
  <string id="15105">Here’s the cassette. You should get rid of it.</string>
  <string id="15106">I knew there was a reason why I liked you, Redgrave! I’ll watch this tape again on long winter evenings!</string>
  <string id="15107">Threaten</string>
  <string id="15108">Did I ask for your opinion? Shut up and listen! I need a promotion. Get it?</string>
  <string id="15109">I’ll tear you to pieces, you little shit! Security!</string>
  <string id="15110">I wouldn’t call security just yet. Do you know James Cunningham? One wrong word and he gets to see this recording! You owe me.</string>
  <string id="15111">You're learning fast!</string>
  <string id="15112">I’d do the same if I were you, you cunning little shit-eater. I didn't spend my time on you for nothing. Now go away, you're giving me a headache.</string>
  <string id="15117">-&gt;$15121</string>
  <string id="15118">-&gt;$15119</string>
  <string id="15332">C’mon, Redgrave! Have you got the girls? The party starts as soon as you have ‘em, heh-heh...</string>
  <string id="15333">To record the party, the video cameras need to be in place before it starts.</string>
  <string id="9663">Hello my darling! You called?</string>
  <string id="9664">Clarify details</string>
  <string id="9665">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="9666">I’m the one who can make your every fantasy come true! Not me personally, of course... though you are cute!</string>
  <string id="9667">-&gt;$12563</string>
  <string id="9668">So, what’ll it be, handsome? You called for some emergency sexual services?</string>
  <string id="9669">-&gt;$9755</string>
  <string id="9670">Yes, I’m calling about two girls.</string>
  <string id="9671">Only two? Honey, I’m disappointed in you! Just two girls for such a handsome, strong boy...</string>
  <string id="9672">Two’s all I need! Well, not me personally, but...</string>
  <string id="9673">Oh sure, sweetie, it’s for a friend... I know...</string>
  <string id="9674">Anyway, two is enough!</string>
  <string id="9675">Have it your way. Choose whoever you like, then we’ll talk details.</string>
  <string id="9677">-&gt;$9676</string>
  <string id="9678">Yes my darling!</string>
  <string id="9679">Choose an escort</string>
  <string id="9680">-&gt;$6265</string>
  <string id="9681">So, made your mind up?</string>

  <string id="9693">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="9694">Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="9695">Confirm choice</string>
  <string id="9696">Yeah, let’s go with these two. About the money...</string>
  <string id="9697">Don’t worry, darling, I know how it all works. The girls will go down in the books as hired freight handlers. I’ve already sent the bill to your accountants. You have a nice time, you rascal.</string>
  <string id="9698">Hi. I’m Olympia. I love physical exercises - some more than others. Maybe we can work up a sweat together?</string>
  <string id="9699">-&gt;$6265</string>
  <string id="9700">I can show you that pure pleasure has a name. And that name is Emilyder.</string>
  <string id="9701">That’s an exotic name...</string>
  <string id="9702">Not at all, silly! It’s the most patriotic name there is!</string>
  <string id="9703">I’m Angelina. Choose me and I’ll show you heaven.</string>
  <string id="9704">Remember my name - Violetta. Everyone always leaves with a smile on their face.</string>
  <string id="9705">I’m Leadith.</string>
  <string id="9706">Edith?</string>
  <string id="9707">Leadith! I can love you like my parents loved the Leader.</string>
  <string id="9709">-&gt;$9708</string>
  <string id="9711">-&gt;$9710</string>
  <string id="9712">I’m...</string>
  <string id="9713">Use your real name</string>
  <string id="9714">... Evan Redgrave.</string>
  <string id="9715">Redgrave. I knew a Redgrave... good guy. What can I do for you?</string>
  <string id="9716">Use a fake name</string>
  <string id="9717">... Abram Shniperson.</string>
  <string id="9718">If you’re a Shniperson, I’m a ballerina in the Patriotic Theater. But in our Ministry, who cares? Go on...</string>
  <string id="9719">Well, recently my much-loved grandma was sent for the Blissful Sleep. But the old hag hid some of her valuables in an armchair first.</string>
  <string id="9720">The chair was then requisitioned by the State Services Fund, and I really need to know where it is now. Can you help? I can make it worth your while!</string>
  <string id="9721">What does “make it worth your while” mean?</string>
  <string id="9722">I’ll give you a bribe! You guys take bribes, don’t you? So I’ll just bribe you! So that you help me!</string>
  <string id="9723">It’s not a bribe, sir. It’s a contribution to the Ministry Fund.</string>
  <string id="9724">Yeah whatever! Here’s some money! Money for you to take!</string>
  <string id="9725">How much is in there?</string>

  <string id="9729">Whoa...</string>
  <string id="9730">That’s what I’m saying! I’ll leave this envelope here, alright?</string>
  <string id="9731">Come back tomorrow. I’ll try to find something out.</string>

  <string id="9734">Ferguson’s trying to find out who’s stealing bribes. And he suspects you.</string>
  <string id="9735">But I give him every last penny!</string>
  <string id="9736">I’ve warned you. The rest is up to you.</string>
  <string id="9737">You are a good man! Thank you.</string>

  <string id="9757">Yes.</string>

  <string id="9759">You bring your “package”?</string>
  <string id="9760">Whoops...</string>
  <string id="9761">Well go get it quick, before the day’s over!</string>

  <string id="8750">There’s not enough time for a walk.</string>
  <string id="10068">Go to the square</string>
  <string id="10069">Walk around the building</string>
  <string id="10070">Go to the guard's partner</string>

  <string id="14756">Search for the merchant that Marwitz mentioned</string>
  <string id="8754">There is a raging sea of people on the central square. Somewhere in the distance, a speaker is shouting at the top of his lungs. His speech, amplified by the loudspeakers, carries over the heads of the crowd. “There can be no mercy for the bloody mercenaries of the Boreans, these rotten murderers, spies, saboteurs and pests!” Thousands of voices echo this call.</string>
  <string id="8756">Chant “All hail the Leader!”</string>
  <string id="8758">You shout with the crowd until you lose your voice. Exhausted from the stress and deafened by the cries, you go home.</string>
  <string id="8760">-&gt;$11420</string>
  <string id="8762">Remain silent and watch</string>
  <string id="8764">Nearby a nondescript man in a gray coat looks carefully over the crowd, and then nods to you.</string>
  <string id="8766">Nod back</string>
  <string id="8768">The stranger glances meaningfully at a backstreet and walks briskly into it.</string>
  <string id="8770">Go after him</string>
  <string id="8772">When you approach, the Gray Coat shows you a policeman's badge and asks if you're his backup.</string>
  <string id="8774">Lie and say you are his backup</string>
  <string id="8776">The policeman informs you that he spotted a particularly dangerous wanted criminal in the crowd. He asks you to help apprehend the criminal, because his partner is on the other side of the square.</string>
  <string id="8778">-&gt;$11299</string>
  <string id="8780">Having established a joint plan of action, you make your way through the crowd to the tall man and pin him down. The policeman immediately puts handcuffs on him and you catch a glimpse of an explosive belt under the criminal's jacket. The terrorist is led away, and you quickly leave the square before the Gray Coat decides to ask which department you are from.</string>
  <string id="8782">Lie and say you have another mission</string>
  <string id="8784">The man nods knowingly and returns to the square. A few moments later there is a deafening explosion! The gateway shields you from the debris, but what you see on the square will give you nightmares until the end of your days...</string>
  <string id="8786">You tell him honestly that you came to the square by chance and do not have any connection to the police. He nods in understanding.</string>
  <string id="8788">Offer help</string>
  <string id="8790">The Gray Coat thinks for a moment and then lays his cards on the table: he's spotted a particularly dangerous wanted criminal in the crowd. He needs help apprehending him, because his partner is on the other side of the square.</string>
  <string id="8792">Having established a joint plan of action, you make your way through the crowd to the tall man and pin him down. The policeman immediately puts handcuffs on him and you catch a glimpse of an explosive belt under the criminal's jacket. The terrorist is led away, and the Gray Coat writes down your name, salutes you, then gets into the car with the criminal and rides away.</string>
  <string id="8795">Excuse yourself and leave</string>
  <string id="8797">You leave the backstreet and go home. After walking a few blocks you hear an explosion. You shudder to think what might have happened if you had stayed there a few more minutes.</string>
  <string id="8799">Stay put</string>
  <string id="8801">Ignoring the man, you continue to stare around for a few more minutes. When you start to think that you might as well pop in to the nearest bar, there is a deafening explosion near you.</string>
  <string id="8803">The statue of the Leader in the square blows into pieces, one of which hits you in the head. Dying, you wonder, “Have I just been killed by the Leader's mustache?”</string>
  <string id="8805">Go home</string>
  <string id="8807">You get home safe and sound.</string>
  <string id="8809">Disappear into the crowd</string>
  <string id="8811">You have seen this look before. That's how the Special Department hounds look when they spot their prey, and you really don't want to be brought in for questioning for not praising the Leader along with the rest. You blend in to the crowd and leave the square in a roundabout way. You're stopped in your tracks by the sounds of an explosion behind you and screams for help.</string>
  <string id="8813">-&gt;$14811</string>
  <string id="8815">Through the clouds of smoke you see an old man lying in a pool of blood. Your gaze falls on the expensive watch in his vest pocket. On the pavement next to him sits a girl squeezing his hand. You can make out the words “help my grandpa!” through her sobs.</string>
  <string id="8820">Take the watch</string>
  <string id="8822">The gold watch on a chain leaves the old man's pocket and goes into yours. You leave for home immediately, dropping by a pawnshop on the way.</string>
  <string id="8824">-&gt;$11406</string>
  <string id="8826">You leave the square and get home safely.</string>
  <string id="8828">Continue watching</string>
  <string id="8830">Ignoring the man, you continue to stare around for a few more minutes. When you start to think that you might as well pop into the nearest bar, there is a deafening explosion near you.

  <string id="11056">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="11057">-&gt;$6933</string>
  <string id="11379">You manage to heave the old man over your shoulder and carry him to the nearest ambulance. The paramedics bandage him up quickly; he will live. </string>
  <string id="8834">Dirty streets, shady characters in the doorways and the overbearing stench of poverty. The guard's home is located on the very outskirts of the city.</string>
  <string id="8840">The End</string>
  <string id="10101">Signs of repair work indicate that the owner is trying to look after the place. You stop in front of a cracked, but still sturdy, oak door.</string>
  <string id="10102">Knock on the door</string>
  <string id="10103">Scratching the belly under his T-shirt, a huge unshaven man opens the door.</string>
  <string id="10104">Despite his menacing appearance, he looks friendly and gestures you in.</string>
  <string id="10105">He gives you a stony stare.</string>
  <string id="10106">Seeing your feebleness and the fact that you came alone, the man opens the door and nods his head, inviting you inside.</string>
  <string id="10107">He looks you up and down, nods agreeably and asks why you came to his home.</string>
  <string id="10108">Enter without knocking</string>
  <string id="10109">You push the door and it gives way, but a sharp blow from the other side brings it back to its place.</string>
  <string id="10110">The foot you used to try to jam the door open responds with a crunch.</string>
  <string id="10111">A coarse male voice from behind the door proposes that you get out of here you want to stay alive.</string>
  <string id="10112">Apologize for the intrusion</string>
  <string id="10113">You apologize for your tactlessness and say that you are here on a business visit and would like to see the owner.</string>
  <string id="10114">Scratching the belly under his T-shirt, a huge unshaven man opens the door and gives you a stony stare.</string>
  <string id="10115">You feel nervous and can't string two words together.</string>
  <string id="10116">Pretend to leave then come back</string>
  <string id="10117">You try to enter the building again, overcoming the resistance from inside. This time the door swings back into place even faster, and hits you in the face. Blood gushes from your nose onto your shirt, and you can hear a bar lowering behind the door.</string>
  <string id="10118">The door is locked.</string>
  <string id="10119">It's a little damp inside. There are bottles and cigarette butts everywhere, and the smell of poverty hangs in the air.</string>
  <string id="10120">A few short-cropped children's heads look out of the back room, but immediately hide.</string>
  <string id="10121">Tell him why you’re here</string>
  <string id="10122">As soon as you mention the guard who sent you, the man begins to frown and grind his teeth. He says he's not going to help that jerk, and that he can kiss his... Well, apparently he's not in the mood for a heart to heart talk.</string>
  <string id="10123">Ask for more details</string>
  <string id="10124">A little push was all it took to get the man to tell you everything.</string>
  <string id="10125">Before becoming a security guard, he worked as a debt collector for a local gangster. When his boss was killed, he got a job in security and started selling confiscated items to pay off his card debts and buy booze. Everything was going well until his new partner found out about it and threatened to tell everything.</string>
  <string id="10126">So he had to return to his usual line of business - kicking the debts out of poor bastards. And if his former partner sends someone else to him, he’ll regret it.</string>
  <string id="10127">You thank him for the information and leave the building.</string>
  <string id="10128">You don't carry enough confidence in your voice to get the man talk.</string>
  <string id="10129">Leave the building</string>
  <string id="10130">Your task was to find the partner, and you found him. You politely say goodbye and leave the building.</string>
  <string id="8841">Turning from People's Wrath Square into an alley, you notice a group of children beating up a homeless man. A man in a raincoat is standing next to them and writing something down in a notebook.</string>
  <string id="8842">Coming closer, you decide to ask what's going on. The man in the raincoat puts away his notebook and says that this is a group of children from the Young Guard patriotic camp.</string>
  <string id="8843">The children are undergoing a course of basic military training and patriotic education. This is their first trip to the city. The counselor is dissatisfied with their behavior and considers them too passive.</string>
  <string id="8844">They give a bonus for each child brought to them. The camp brings the children up to be model citizens. The counselor silently continues to look at the children. The homeless man has not moved in a long time.</string>
  <string id="8845">You turn around and go home.</string>
  <string id="8846">The End</string>
  <string id="10075">There's nothing interesting near the building. You return home.</string>
  <string id="10076">You can hear children screaming in the background and smell cooking food through the unwashed windows of the first floor apartments.</string>
  <string id="10077">The door to the entrance has been torn off its hinges, and there is a fresh inscription on the wall that reads “The Leader can go fu...” (the end of the phrase has been painted over).</string>
  <string id="10078">A stylish leather sofa is blocking your path on the first floor stairs.</string>
  <string id="10079">A plump, red-faced man is fussing over it. He is trying to drag the sofa upstairs by himself. The neighbor turns to you for help.</string>
  <string id="10080">Help him move the sofa</string>
  <string id="10081">Puffing and panting, you carry the sofa up to the fifth floor. When you get to the final turn, a sharp pain shoots through your back. It's good that your neighbor isn't a complete scumbag, and gives you a bottle of good whiskey for your work.</string>
  <string id="10082">Ask where the sofa came from</string>
  <string id="10083">The neighbor tells you how he accidentally came upon a furniture voucher, and accidentally saw this sofa in a shop, and accidentally had some money with him, but his shifty eyes tell you that he's lying.</string>
  <string id="10084">-&gt;$12501</string>
  <string id="10085">You tell your neighbor that you don't believe his fairy tale and want to report this chic leather sofa.</string>
  <string id="10086">The neighbor turns pale and starts begging you not to report him. He tells you about his sick wife and her demands to get a “normal sofa”.</string>
  <string id="10087">That he bribed the head of his shop floor, who got the voucher from someone else. The neighbor offers you money for your silence.</string>
  <string id="10088">-&gt;$13343</string>
  <string id="10089">You give him a meaningful look and nod. The neighbor takes everything he has out of his pocket and continues to push the sofa up the stairs.</string>
  <string id="10090">Refuse the bribe</string>
  <string id="10091">The neighbor breathes a sigh of relief. He says that he only has enough money to pay the utility bills. Then he runs home and comes back with a bottle as a thank you gift. He doesn't ask for any more help with the sofa. You climb the stairs.</string>
  <string id="10092">Report the sofa to the manager</string>
  <string id="10093">The manager listens to you with interest and promises to look into it. He reduces your utility bill as a thank you for taking such a noble stand. He now has a lovely sofa, and you haven’t seen your neighbor since.</string>
  <string id="10094">Go home</string>
  <string id="10095">The neighbor isn't happy about your curiosity and doesn’t hide it. You are unable to persuade him.</string>
  <string id="10096">Don't ask questions and help</string>
  <string id="10097">Deciding that everyone has to do what they can, you help him bring the sofa to the right floor. When you get to the final turn, a sharp pain shoots down your back and you reach the apartment in a half-bent state. It's good that the neighbor isn't a complete scumbag, and gives you a bottle of good whiskey for the trouble.</string>
  <string id="10098">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="10099">You pass him by. The neighbor mutters incredulously, but leaves you alone.</string>
  <string id="10100">The End</string>
  <string id="10131">You come to the old river port.</string>
  <string id="10132">A few years ago, a fire destroyed most of it. All that remains is a quay, a brick warehouses and a few structures behind the railway tracks.</string>
  <string id="10133">The scientist that Rakovich talked about lives around here. But how can you find him?</string>
  <string id="10134">Shout “Professor, I need insulin!”</string>
  <string id="10135">The light river breeze carries your words into the void. Dogs bark in the distance.</string>
  <string id="10136">Go to the warehouses</string>
  <string id="10137">At first glance, the warehouses seem abandoned. As you come closer, you notice fresh tire tracks on the ground. There is a sign on the fence: “Do not enter”.</string>
  <string id="10138">Go past the fence</string>
  <string id="10139">You take a couple of steps and two large, armed men in uniform appear next to you. You have broken the rules, and the military aren’t happy about it.</string>
  <string id="10140">Your ministerial employee ID saves you from prison, but not from a fine. At least they didn't shoot you.</string>
  <string id="10141">-&gt;$10260</string>
  <string id="10142">The sign is very clear, so go back.</string>
  <string id="10143">Go to the barge at the pier</string>
  <string id="10144">You see a dirty-faced boy on the shore by the barge. He is kicking pebbles absentmindedly and is clearly waiting for someone. The boy starts to get nervous when he notices you.</string>
  <string id="10145">Talk to the boy</string>
  <string id="10146">You call out to the boy, but he makes a show of not being able to hear you.</string>
  <string id="10148">-&gt;$10147</string>
  <string id="10149">The boy reluctantly enters into conversation. You find out that he is an orphan and lives with his grandfather, who at the moment is stealing coal from the warehouse nearby. It’s cold in their cellar, and one bag of coal is enough to stoke the furnace for a whole month!</string>
  <string id="10150">The usual story. Everyone survives however they can.</string>
  <string id="10151">You can’t get the boy to talk.</string>
  <string id="10152">Introduce yourself as a police officer</string>
  <string id="10153">Putting on a stern appearance, you say that you work for the police and that the boy is obliged to answer your questions.</string>
  <string id="10154">It turns out the boy has the right reaction: he kicks you in the groin and runs towards the warehouses shouting “we’ve got trouble!” while you try to straighten up.</string>
  <string id="10155">Go back</string>
  <string id="10156">Inspect the barge</string>
  <string id="10157">The barge looks like an old rusty washtub. It looks like some homeless people have settled in here - you find a couch and a bunch of old things in one of the cabins.</string>
  <string id="10159">-&gt;$10158</string>
  <string id="10160">The only thing of worth is a bunch of wires, which local residents must have wanted to sell for scrap.</string>
  <string id="10161">Take the wires</string>
  <string id="10162">Rightly so - why throw away old wires? Maybe you could put them to use?</string>
  <string id="10163">There’s nothing more to take.</string>
  <string id="10164">Go along the railroad tracks</string>
  <string id="10165">The tracks stretch deep into the port. One branch dives off into a dark tunnel, and the other leads to an abandoned freight shed - a temporary warehouse where carriages were once loaded.</string>
  <string id="10166">Go to the tunnel</string>
  <string id="10167">The entrance to the tunnel is closed off with heavy gates. Someone removed the wires from the control panel - copper is highly-prized at scrap recycling centers.</string>
  <string id="10168">Try to open the doors with your hands</string>
  <string id="10169">You try to open the gate with your hands, but only manage to tear off a couple of your nails.</string>
  <string id="10170">Connect wires</string>
  <string id="10171">The “foolproof” design that only allows each wire to be inserted into a certain slot helps you bring the console back to life.</string>
  <string id="10172">Bulbs light up, and the gate opens and lets you into the shade of the tunnel.</string>
  <string id="10173">Enter the tunnel</string>
  <string id="10174">Go back</string>
  <string id="10175">Go to the freight shed</string>
  <string id="10176">Despite the general desolation, the old building looks in reasonable shape: the windows are intact, the graffiti on the walls are almost invisible, and the door is closed with a robust lock.</string>
  <string id="10177">Try to break the lock</string>
  <string id="10178">Learning to pick locks was a very good idea. You open the door with ease.</string>
  <string id="10179">There is a small office inside: cabinets, desks, books and a huge safe.</string>
  <string id="10180">Look around the room</string>
  <string id="10181">Suddenly you hear voices from the other side of the building. It could be the owners of the safe, or it could be thieves. You retreat to the door and take a book from the table along the way.</string>
  <string id="10182">Raindrops begin to fall from the sky, muffling your steps and letting you escape unnoticed. The scientist's laboratory is definitely not here, so there’s no point going back to the shed.</string>
  <string id="10183">You decide not to risk it and leave. The scientist's laboratory is definitely not here, so there’s no point going back to the shed.</string>
  <string id="10184">You’ve never had to deal with a tumbler plate lock before. You can't open it, so you go back to where you started.</string>
  <string id="10185">Stop searching</string>
  <string id="10186">Searching the port for a person who doesn’t want to be found is a hopeless undertaking. You need to rethink your strategy and come back later.</string>
  <string id="10187">The far side of the tunnel has collapsed, but there’s light in a side utility room. Inside it you find an old man with disheveled gray hair. He obviously wasn't expecting you, but he tries not to show his fear.</string>
  <string id="10188">The old man mutters his name and tries to complain. After a short dialogue it becomes clear that this was who you were looking for - a chemist who carried out his experiments far from the ministries and universities.</string>
  <string id="10189">Ask why he is hiding</string>
  <string id="10190">The old man says that pacifists have to make any and all sacrifices for the their ideals. So he left the Ministry of Science embroiled in scandal after learning that his inventions were being used by the military. He had to go into hiding when his wife reported him for his laboratory in the attic of their home.</string>
  <string id="10191">Ask him for insulin</string>
  <string id="10192">You talk about children who are suffering from diabetes and will die without insulin, and ask the old man to name a price for the leftover drugs.</string>
  <string id="10193">Without hesitation, the old man agrees to give the medicine still stored in the warehouses to a good cause. He says that there are at least a dozen such warehouses, meaning that the children will have enough medicine. For a while, anyway.</string>
  <string id="10194">You can inform Rakovich that you have fulfilled her request and come to an agreement. It won't cost her a penny.</string>
  <string id="10195">The End</string>
  <string id="11408">It is usually easy to find the manager, but today you look around the whole building and even ask the neighbors - he is nowhere to be found.</string>
  <string id="11409">Some of the tenants recall that the manager was going to the Ministry. Every public office comes with its share of paperwork.</string>
  <string id="11410">After a while you meet the manager. There is anxiety in his voice.</string>
  <string id="11411">Ask about cameras</string>
  <string id="11412">You ask the manager about buying cameras. The manager is not very surprised by your question. He tells you the price.</string>
  <string id="11413">Buy a camera</string>
  <string id="11414">You buy a camera. The manager doesn't care why you need it.</string>
  <string id="11416">-&gt;$11415</string>
  <string id="11418">-&gt;$11417</string>
  <string id="11419">You decide to think it over and come back later.</string>
  <string id="11421">-&gt;$11420</string>
  <string id="11380">Remembering Rose Everdeen's assignment, you decide to walk down the street in search of a candidate for the patriotic quiz.</string>
  <string id="11381">There are a lot of people on the sidewalk. You have to choose who to talk to.</string>
  <string id="11382">Police patrol</string>
  <string id="11383">An officer and several patrolmen are escorting a professor to the station. He was giving a lecture and, in violation of the Ministry of Science's directives, presented the argument that there may be more than two digits after the decimal in Pi.</string>
  <string id="11384">You explain your problem to the officer - it seems you caught him in a good mood. He offers the professor the opportunity to atone for his sins by participating in the patriotic quiz.</string>
  <string id="11385">The professor instantly agrees and looks at you in the hope that you will rid him of the company of the police.</string>
  <string id="11386">Agree to take the professor</string>
  <string id="11387">You agree to the officer's proposal. The patrol disappears, and the professor warmly thanks you for setting him free - by law, any black mark against his name could get him fired from the university. As a sign of gratitude, he gives you a book he had on him at the time of his arrest, and promises to come tomorrow at the appointed time.</string>
  <string id="11388">Refuse to take the professor</string>
  <string id="11389">You refuse, citing the professor's unreliability as your reason - if he broke the law once, what's to stop him from lying to the police officers and failing to fulfil his promise?</string>
  <string id="11390">The officer agrees with you and, after some thought, orders one of the patrolmen to find out where to sign up. Their department could use some extra patriotism points.</string>
  <string id="11391">Shoe shiner</string>
  <string id="11392">The dirty man covered in shoe polish doesn't look like an expert in patriotic acts and achievements, but he’ll do any job that pays.</string>
  <string id="11393">After hearing you out, he asks for a fee.</string>
  <string id="11394">-&gt;$8092</string>
  <string id="11395">You easily part with the money and explain where he has to go to participate in the quiz.</string>
  <string id="11396">Don't pay</string>
  <string id="11397">The cleaner goes back to his work, and you go back to looking around the street.</string>
  <string id="11398">Activist at the crossroads</string>
  <string id="11399">Fully occupied with glorifying the Leader, his actions and his magnificent mind, the activist doesn't notice you right away.</string>
  <string id="11400">You tell him what you need, and the activist almost jumps for joy!</string>
  <string id="11401">It turns out that taking part in the patriotic quiz is his childhood dream - he’s been training for it since a young age. He recently even tried to buy a place on the team, but no one agreed to sell it.</string>
  <string id="11402">Sell participation for</string>
  <string id="11403">You tell him that his dream can come true, but not for free. Joyful, the activist immediately gives you the money and asks how to get to the quiz. He almost faints with happiness.</string>
  <string id="11404">Offer free participation</string>
  <string id="11405">The activist almost cries in happiness when he finds out that he'll soon be taking part in the quiz. His joy is infectious, and you go home with a smile on your face.</string>
  <string id="11407">-&gt;$11406</string>
  <string id="15292">The street quickly empties as it gets dark.</string>
  <string id="10209">Leader's Street, where Anthony Solerno's home stood, is on the other side of the city, in the green zone. Judging by the fact that only important officials and general-level military men are allowed to live there, the former mafioso clearly had a good thing going on.</string>
  <string id="10210">Use the subway</string>
  <string id="10211">Luckily there are vacant seats in the car, so you can relax and even take a nap.</string>
  <string id="10212">Not enough time.</string>
  <string id="10213">Order a taxi</string>
  <string id="10214">Estimating the distance to Anthony's home, you decide to order a taxi. The taxi driver confidently dives into the city alleys, and for a while you ride in silence.</string>
  <string id="10215">A few blocks later you notice that the car isn't going to Leader's Street, but rather in the opposite direction.</string>
  <string id="10216">Tell the driver that he’s lost his way</string>
  <string id="10217">Turning on all of your charm and politeness, you inform the driver that Leader's Street is on the other side of the city.</string>
  <string id="10218">In response, the taxi driver hits the brakes, turns to you and starts ranting about the kind of idiot who’d try to teach him, Alejandro Perez, how to drive a taxi. He promises to throw you out of the car if you say another word.</string>
  <string id="10219">Insist that you’re right</string>
  <string id="10220">It turns out that Alejandro Perez wasn't joking. He forcefully pulls you out of the car and hits you on the head a couple of times, then leaves you in an unfamiliar place.</string>
  <string id="10221">If you go to Leader's Street with no money and with two black eyes, you’ll certainly be arrested by the police. It looks like your trip is over for today, and you wind your way back home.</string>
  <string id="10222">-&gt;$11345</string>
  <string id="10223">A few bills and your apologies calm the taxi driver down and he continues his journey. It turns out that he actually did know a shortcut, and he rightfully earned a tip.</string>
  <string id="10224">You don't have enough money. The taxi driver throws you out of the taxi.</string>
  <string id="10225">Ride in silence</string>
  <string id="10226">Relying on the driver's experience, you silently examine the unfamiliar landscapes outside the window. Following a chain of narrow streets, he brings you directly to Anthony's home, cutting a good ten kilometers off the journey.</string>
  <string id="10227">-&gt;$14823</string>
  <string id="10228">Go home</string>
  <string id="10229">The building where Fat Tony used to live has seen better days. Once a beautiful mansion in the classical style, the empty windows and burnt-out walls now gape at you.</string>
  <string id="10230">There was a fire here not long ago - the police are still standing guard and not letting onlookers into the building.</string>
  <string id="10231">Ask a passerby what happened</string>
  <string id="10232">The neighbors have come to see what happened, dressed in whatever they had on. A stately man in a general's tunic and flowery shorts scans you from head to toe scornfully and turns away, refusing to even talk to you.</string>
  <string id="10233">Ask the police what happened</string>
  <string id="10234">As politely as you can and without making any sudden movements, you ask the nearest policeman about what happened. Luckily enough, he turns out to be a big man with the simple face of a country-dweller. He says that the cause of the fire is unknown, and that a woman and a child were killed in the incident.</string>
  <string id="10235">Ask to examine the crime scene</string>
  <string id="10236">You ask the big guy to let you in, and he’s more than willing to oblige - for a fee.</string>
  <string id="10238">-&gt;$10237</string>
  <string id="10239">The banknote instantly disappears into the policeman's palm and he lifts up the cordon tape for you.</string>
  <string id="10240">You don't have enough money for a bribe. Fat Tony will have to hear this sad story without any of the details.</string>
  <string id="10241">Go home</string>
  <string id="10242">You’ve found out enough: Anthony Solerno's home burned down, and his family is dead. People these days aren’t generally in the habit of shooting the messenger - though that may not be the case when it comes to former mobsters.</string>
  <string id="10243">Once luxurious, the building is now a miserable sight. Burnt furniture, soot-covered paintings, wet books and ash everywhere.</string>
  <string id="10244">Examine the hall</string>
  <string id="10245">Among the general mess, you notice a half-burned painting and something metal behind it. Pushing aside the work of art, you find a wall safe.</string>
  <string id="10246">Crack the safe</string>
  <string id="10247">There’s no such thing as luck. If you know how to open locks, then it’s sure to come in handy some day. Inside the safe you find the remains of some papers and a slightly burnt bundle of banknotes. They are almost intact, which is lucky.</string>
  <string id="10248">You’ve never had to deal with a tumbler plate lock before. You can't open it.</string>
  <string id="10249">Leave the safe alone</string>
  <string id="10250">It's unlikely that the police missed the safe and left something of value inside.</string>
  <string id="10251">Inspect the bedroom</string>
  <string id="10252">A luxurious four-poster bed takes up almost the entire room, and there isn't a lot of other furniture.</string>
  <string id="10253">Examine the bed</string>
  <string id="10254">You don't find anything interesting</string>
  <string id="10255">Examine the bedside table</string>
  <string id="10257">Examine the dressing table</string>
  <string id="10258">There's nothing here.</string>
  <string id="10259">You find a gold ring in the bottom drawer.</string>
  <string id="10261">-&gt;$10260</string>
  <string id="10262">Inspect the nursery</string>
  <string id="10263">Leave the building</string>
  <string id="10264">The End</string>
  <string id="10265">You go out for a short walk and find yourself in the red light district.</string>
  <string id="10266">In one of the alleys, a girl with bright makeup and in an unpatriotic mini-skirt blocks your way on a narrow sidewalk. She offers to spend some time with you in her room nearby.</string>
  <string id="10267">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="10268">You don’t have that much money with you.</string>
  <string id="10269">You exchange a few banknotes for a couple of dozen minutes of pleasure in the girl's room. You never ask her name.</string>
  <string id="10270">When leaving the building, you run into a ostentatiously-dressed man who hands you his business card.</string>
  <string id="10271">Take it</string>
  <string id="10272">The man smiles and tells you to call any time.</string>
  <string id="10273">Feeling pleasant fatigue throughout your whole body, you go home.</string>
  <string id="10275">-&gt;$10274</string>
  <string id="10276">You ignore him and go outside. The girl you just left shouts from the window that you forgot your wallet on the table. She throws it straight into your hands.</string>
  <string id="10277">Of course, it’s missing a few bills, but in their place is a card with a phone number and the silhouette of a naked woman.</string>
  <string id="10278">Not wanting to return to this den of sin, you go home.</string>
  <string id="10279">Apart from some change, you find a card with a phone number and the silhouette of a naked woman in you wallet.</string>
  <string id="10280">The girl, inspired by the fact that you spent your last money on her, slipped in a fifty and her business card.</string>
  <string id="10281">You never know where luck might find you. Feeling a pleasant fatigue in your whole body, you go home.</string>
  <string id="10282">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="10283">A pimp appears next to the girl. He really wants to know the reason for your refusal.</string>
  <string id="10284">Not interested in such services</string>
  <string id="10285">The man slips a business card into your jacket pocket and tells you to call whenever you decide to take an interest.</string>
  <string id="10286">This incident and the pimp's nasty smile have spoiled your mood, so you go home.</string>
  <string id="10287">You don't like this girl</string>
  <string id="10288">The pimp slips a business card into your jacket pocket, while telling you that he has a lot of other girls who are eager to get acquainted, and that you can call him any time.</string>
  <string id="10289">This incident has spoiled your mood, so you go home.</string>
  <string id="10290">Don't like girls in general</string>
  <string id="10291">Not at all embarrassed, the pimp takes out his business card and slips it into the breast pocket of your jacket, saying that he doesn’t just have girls, but also young men and inanimate objects for “special purposes”.</string>
  <string id="10292">Not wishing to find out what that means, you leave in a hurry.</string>
  <string id="10293">Say you're impotent</string>
  <string id="10294">Even this killer of an argument doesn’t make the pimp flinch. He literally pushes his business card into your hands and tells you that he has experts who are even capable of arousing the interest of the Leader himself.</string>
  <string id="10295">The End</string>
  <string id="10296">Nathan Kehler is glad to see you and asks about the purpose of your visit.</string>
  <string id="10297">Sell ministerial bonds</string>
  <string id="10298">Nathan will buy the bonds for</string>
  <string id="10299">Sell</string>
  <string id="10300">Nathan buys the bonds.</string>
  <string id="10301">Don't sell</string>
  <string id="10302">Nathan is not happy that you changed your mind.</string>
  <string id="10303">Buy a fake pass</string>
  <string id="10304">Nathan gives you a pass.</string>
  <string id="10305">-&gt;$11415</string>
  <string id="10306">Buy a memory unit</string>
  <string id="10307">Nathan gives you a memory unit.</string>
  <string id="10308">Buy a wig</string>
  <string id="10309">Nathan gives you a wig. He smiles slyly and straightens his top hat.</string>
  <string id="10310">Buy a bottle of whiskey</string>
  <string id="10311">Nathan gives you a bottle. He advises you to never mix soda with single malt whiskey.</string>
  <string id="10312">Arrange soap deliveries</string>
  <string id="10313">You tell the story of children from the House of Misfits. Nathan shakes his head sympathetically. He is ready to help the poor dirty children for</string>
  <string id="10314">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="10315">Nathan gives his word (he can be trusted) that he will deliver boxes of soap to the House of Misfits.</string>
  <string id="10316">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="10317">Go home</string>
  <string id="6329">TRADE</string>
  <string id="13816">Talk about hiring mercenaries to shut down the plant</string>
  <string id="13817">You tell Nathan the story of the Suburb and ask about people who would be prepared to protect the interests of the workers.</string>
  <string id="13823">-&gt;$8092</string>
  <string id="13824">Nathan says: “What lovely numbers! They reminded me of another number: 14-061-789. Call it, and they’ll definitely hear you out.”</string>
  <string id="14757">Nathan sympathizes, but he is not ready to sacrifice his own wellbeing for the sake of others. He knows some people who are, but this information costs money.</string>
  <string id="10322">Go home</string>
  <string id="13827">Using the address that DeSalvo gave you, you find a factory that has definitely seen better times. There is dirt, desolation and ruin everywhere. There is a warehouse to your right, a production building to your left, and a neat factory management building a little further away.</string>
  <string id="13828">Go to the factory management</string>
  <string id="13829">You search the offices and find the director of the factory inside one of them.</string>
  <string id="13830">After you mention DeSalvo, he straightens up, blinks and falls into a stupor.</string>
  <string id="13832">-&gt;$13831</string>
  <string id="13833">The director fixes his gaze on your and says that the factory has been having minor difficulties for a long time - the equipment has been taken away, and the workers and supplies are long gone.</string>
  <string id="13834">The only way he can help is to give you a voucher to get the wrap from the warehouse. There may be some reserves left.</string>
  <string id="13835">As he continues scrutinize you, the director gradually turns pale. Sweat appears on his face, and he sinks to the floor.</string>
  <string id="13836">You have to raise the alarm and call an ambulance for him, but you definitely won't be getting any wrap today.</string>
  <string id="13837">-&gt;$10353</string>
  <string id="13838">As he comes out of his stupor, the director quickly sweeps the money into a drawer and fills in the voucher to get the goods from the warehouse.</string>
  <string id="13839">The director's eyes light up with greedy fire, but the money you have won't be enough.</string>
  <string id="13840">Yell at him</string>
  <string id="13841">You shout at the director, describing his heritage and sexual proclivities in great detail.</string>
  <string id="13842">Having gone through several color changes during your speech, the director reaches out a trembling hand with a voucher to get the wrap from the warehouse.</string>
  <string id="13843">Go to the warehouse</string>
  <string id="13844">Scratching his stomach, the warehouse manager appears from the far corner.</string>
  <string id="13845">He says that, firstly, he won't give you anything without a voucher for the goods, and, secondly, there’s nothing to give anyway.</string>
  <string id="13846">Go to the production building</string>
  <string id="13847">The door is locked.</string>
  <string id="13848">Leave the factory and go home</string>
  <string id="13849">The warehouse manager is napping on some boxes when you enter. Opening one eye, he first asks if you’ve brought a voucher for the goods.</string>
  <string id="13850">Ask why he needs a voucher if there is nothing to give</string>
  <string id="13851">He says that without a voucher, he cannot officially refuse to give you the goods. That's how it works.</string>
  <string id="13852">Show him the voucher</string>
  <string id="13853">The warehouse manager impales the voucher on a sharp pin, writes its number in his journal and then throws his hands up again: “We’re outta wrap”.</string>
  <string id="13854">Threaten to complain to the director</string>
  <string id="13855">The man laughs so hard that he has to spend a considerable time wiping away the tears with a dirty handkerchief.</string>
  <string id="13856">When he gets his breath back, he tells you that the real director ran away long ago, and that the worker sitting in the factory management building is only there so that no one suspects anything when inspections are carried out.</string>
  <string id="13857">Ask where to get the wrap</string>
  <string id="13858">The manager rolls his eyes to the ceiling and tells you that he has two rolls, which he bought for his greenhouse.</string>
  <string id="13859">He could sell a spare roll to a worthy buyer.</string>
  <string id="13860">-&gt;$11083</string>
  <string id="13861">Leave the warehouse</string>
  <string id="13862">The manager closes the entrance gate tight so that no one disturbs you. He tells you to wait, before disappearing into the darkness of the warehouse.</string>
  <string id="13863">A few minutes later, he brings you a great roll of wrap and lets you out through a secret door that leads from the warehouse directly to the street.</string>
  <string id="13864">Now it is clear why there is nothing left in the warehouse, but you don’t need anything else anyway.</string>
  <string id="13865">Giving you a look full of contempt, the warehouse manager spits on the floor, silently turns around and leaves.</string>
  <string id="13866">It seems that your proposal was not to his liking, and the meeting has come to an end. Maybe he will be more accommodating if you come back with a different amount?</string>
  <string id="10326">Go home</string>
  <string id="13867">The city library welcomes you with open space and emptiness. Behind the desk sits a pretty librarian in a gray suit which, despite its best efforts, can’t downplay her attractive figure. She yawns.</string>
  <string id="13868">Ask the librarian about the old book</string>
  <string id="13869">The librarian hears you out, takes a deep breath, gives you a piercing look and starts flipping through some documents.</string>
  <string id="13870">After a couple of minutes, she tells you that “The Philosophy of Suffering” is in a closed-off archive. You would need special permission to get it.</string>
  <string id="13871">Find the book in the catalog yourself</string>
  <string id="13872">You find the card for “The Philosophy of Suffering” in the catalogue, but there is a different book on the shelf: “Mince. 100 Ways to Cook Without Meat”. The book you need is nowhere to be found.</string>
  <string id="13873">Ask for permission</string>
  <string id="13874">Noticing that you are only interested in the book, the girl says: “The department that issued permits closed down 3 years ago. I can't help you. Please move away from the desk, I have a lot of work to do.”</string>
  <string id="13875">Maybe she’s just having a bad day, but you can tell that you won’t get anything else from her today.</string>
  <string id="13876">-&gt;$10375</string>
  <string id="13877">Using all of your charm, you ask the girl to show a little understanding and help you with the book.</string>
  <string id="13878">She blushes and whispers that permission is just a formality - but there was a flood recently in the secret archive, and all the books have been moved and dumped in another room. Now you’d be lucky not to break your leg in there.</string>
  <string id="13879">Suggest that she searches while you wait here</string>
  <string id="13880">The girl snorts, saying that she has a lot of work as it is and that other customers are waiting for her. You are the only person in the library, but her indignant look tells you that you won't get any help from her today.</string>
  <string id="13881">Offer to help her find the book</string>
  <string id="13882">The girl is delighted and leads you into the depths of the library. There really is a small room with a sofa, with books piled up almost to the ceiling.</string>
  <string id="13883">You find the book quickly, but the sparks that have been flying between you two from the start keep you there a long time.</string>
  <string id="13884">When you return to the reading room, the flushed librarian straightens her hair and, giggling, adds something else to your order: “The World of Antennas. Size Doesn't Matter”.</string>
  <string id="13885">You don’t remember the name of the girl, but you’ve fulfilled DeSalvo's request and can safely go home.</string>
  <string id="13886">Alas, there is not enough time to search.</string>
  <string id="13887">-&gt;$10353</string>
  <string id="13888">Several crisp bills make the girl forget about permission. After a short time, she brings you the right book. She obviously likes you.</string>
  <string id="13889">You exchange some frivolous hints with her and leave this temple of literature, never to return again. Who goes to the library these days anyway?</string>
  <string id="13890">In a voice ringing with resentment, she tells you that librarians work for love. The love of books, more precisely. They work for an idea, not for money!</string>
  <string id="13891">-&gt;$10147</string>
  <string id="13892">You convince the girl that you have the right to take the book. Hesitating a bit, she agrees and brings you the book. She didn’t like your official tone, but you don’t really care.</string>
  <string id="13893">The girl sticks her nose up in the air and says that even if the Great Leader himself came here without permission, she won't allow such a violation of order!</string>
  <string id="13894">The country is celebrating Puppy Month, introduced in honor of the Wise Leader's beloved dog. It turns out that a Ministry order grants all employees who visit the exhibition a reward.</string>
  <string id="13895">A large crowd has gathered in the Municipal Palace of Events. There are a lot more people than dogs. You need a special permit for a dog, and it's extremely hard to get one.</string>
  <string id="13896">You notice the familiar profile of Albert DeSalvo in the crowd. He is surrounded by huge, square-shaped men with shaved heads. He is holding a miniature dog the size of a handbag.</string>
  <string id="13897">The procession passes through the hall and disappears into a room with the sign “VIP Males”. The entrance is guarded by a man with an expressionless face.</string>
  <string id="13898">Talk to the guard</string>
  <string id="13899">You approach the guard and try to politely start a conversation. The guard hardly notices you and shows no interest.</string>
  <string id="13900">Bribe the guard</string>
  <string id="13901">Realizing that the guard won't tell you anything interesting, you wander around the exhibition for another half an hour, them go home frustrated by this useless waste of time.</string>
  <string id="13902">Yell at the guard</string>
  <string id="13903">With a barely noticeable motion, the guard hits you in the stomach, carefully moves you aside and returns to his place, leaving you to catch your breath.</string>
  <string id="13904">Rush past the guard</string>
  <string id="13905">Imitating the important and haughty look of high-ranking officials, you try to pass by the guard, but he silently blocks the way.</string>
  <string id="13906">You decide to change tactics and take out your wallet. All guards take bribes, and this one is no exception. He asks what you need.</string>
  <string id="13907">Ask for permission to enter</string>
  <string id="13908">The guard shakes his head in frustration - not even a bribe is enough to get him to allow visitors not on the secret list approved personally by the Wise Leader into “VIP Males”.</string>
  <string id="13909">Ask about DeSalvo</string>
  <string id="13910">The guard says that Comrade DeSalvo is an honorary member of the Helmer Canine Club. They also say that this is his favorite dog and he doesn't let anyone near it. Several people have already lost their lives trying to pet it.</string>
  <string id="13912">-&gt;$13911</string>
  <string id="13913">Comrade DeSalvo's dog is insured for a six-figure sum, so it is guarded like the Mayor of Helmer. Or better.</string>
  <string id="13915">-&gt;$13914</string>
  <string id="13916">This dog was gifted to Comrade DeSalvo by the Leader himself as a sign of favor and trust. The dog's name is Spock, after the protagonist of DeSalvo's favorite TV show.</string>
  <string id="13917">-&gt;$11406</string>
  <string id="10338">I'm in a real hurry, could you please let me cut in?</string>
  <string id="10339">If I let you in ahead of me, I won't live to see next spring!</string>
  <string id="10340">-&gt;$6661</string>
  <string id="10341">Can't you see? I’m thirty kilos underweight! Here, look at my papers! If they don't give me some vouchers for a high-calorie diet soon, they'll be receiving a complaint from a very unsatisfied pile of bones...</string>
  <string id="10342">Help him</string>
  <string id="10343">Show me your papers. Maybe I can help.</string>
  <string id="10344">Yes, of course. Here, look...</string>
  <string id="10345">Move him aside</string>
  <string id="10346">Well, while you figure out whether you’re going to stand or lie there, I’m going through.</string>
  <string id="10347">Go and steal something!</string>
  <string id="10348">-&gt;$5706</string>
  <string id="10349">I said I'm not giving you any money, so go and steal something, beggar!</string>
  <string id="10350">Threaten him</string>
  <string id="10351">Have you ever though that someone might make you answer for words like that?</string>
  <string id="10352">Answer to you, scumbag? Go and steal something, I said!</string>
  <string id="10354">-&gt;$10353</string>

  <string id="10356">Now you're talking...</string>
  <string id="10357">Go and steal something, I say!</string>
  <string id="10358">And why should I let you through?</string>
  <string id="10359">Because people should help each other!</string>
  <string id="10360">Just what kind of people, I wonder? And what do you mean “help”?</string>
  <string id="10361">Explain</string>
  <string id="10362">We’re all citizens of the same country, we live under the same sky, breathe the same air…</string>
  <string id="10363">And that's why you think I owe you something? No, mister. I’m not agreeing to that...</string>

  <string id="10365">Don't you know of the law of the singularity of twisted internal properties?</string>
  <string id="10366">Uh... Sorry, what?</string>
  <string id="10367">Well, you should look it up, then! You think about that for now, and just I'll go on ahead, okay?</string>

  <string id="10373">Fragile and defenseless? You? Don’t make me laugh!</string>

  <string id="10378">You’re a naughty one, trying to flatter me like that! You’re lucky I have some free time... I couldn’t let you get into trouble because of me, could I?</string>
  <string id="10379">Young man! The fact that you’re in a hurry is no reason to break with established order.</string>
  <string id="10380">But I'm really in a hurry!</string>
  <string id="10381">And that just emphasizes your lack of discipline! Looks like your supervisor from the Ministry of Labor isn't worth their salt! We didn't tolerate that sort of thing back in my day!</string>

  <string id="10385">Lie convincingly</string>
  <string id="10386">You’re wrong! My supervisor is a wonderful person! He's just waiting for me to bring him some papers so that he can file a report. That's why I'm in a hurry! I can't let him down!</string>
  <string id="10387">Why didn't you just say so? Go ahead!</string>
  <string id="10388">I'm also in a hurry!</string>
  <string id="10389">I have urgent business, too! But you don't see me trying to cut in line!</string>

  <string id="10408">Sure! Kidney, retina, or other organs. You know, most people have no brain and it doesn't bother them!</string>
  <string id="10409">So you buy organs?</string>
  <string id="10410">Yes, and if you bring a friend you’ll get 20% of the cost of their organs!</string>

  <string id="10424">Again, yes. Anyway, I give him my bribes for the day, he opens his safe, and there's a huuuge pile of Patriotic Government Bonds in there!</string>
  <string id="10425">So what? I have a bond too - we were all forced to buy them! Only we’ll never see any money from these “bonds”. It’s all just a fairy tale for suckers.</string>
  <string id="10426">Small fries like us, who only have one bond, won't get a penny. But if you have a whole pile of them and know the right people…</string>

  <string id="10431">We've been watching you for a long time. Have you heard of The New Tomorrow?</string>
  <string id="10432">Ask about The New Tomorrow</string>
  <string id="10433">The New Tomorrow? Those people who fight the Great Leader?</string>
  <string id="10434">Oh yes, they want to paint us as murderers, terrorists and Leader-haters. But we’re fighting against oligarchy, bureaucracy and human rights violations!</string>
  <string id="10435">Do we even have any oligarchs?</string>
  <string id="10436">See, we’re doing our job!</string>
  <string id="10437">Ask about “the blow”</string>
  <string id="10438">What “blow to the bureaucracy” are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="10439">We're going to blow up the new wing of the Ministry building!</string>
  <string id="10440">When it opens, thousands of new bureaucrats will start working there, and we won't be able to get in the way of their work without harming people! We’re not animals, Evan, and we don't kill people for nothing. So we need to blow it up now, while it’s still empty!</string>
  <string id="10441">Ask what they need</string>
  <string id="10442">We need you to meet our man in the Ministry to give him the microchip and password that activate the bomb.</string>
  <string id="10443">Why me?</string>
  <string id="10444">Like I already said, we've been watching you. You have a strong personality, Evan, and you’re capable of taking real action. There’s so much you can change in the Ministry, Evan! Really change, you know? We need people like you!</string>
  <string id="10445">Why should I do this?</string>
  <string id="10446">Do you like the uncontrolled growth of the bureaucratic apparatus and the simultaneous strengthening of its totalitarian functions?</string>
  <string id="10447">Honestly, your plans aren’t so great either...</string>
  <string id="10448">But we can pay you well!</string>
  <string id="10449">Agree to the offer</string>
  <string id="10450">Wow! That's a lot! OK, I agree!</string>
  <string id="10451">The New Tomorrow gives money today and spares no expense for tomorrow! I'm glad that we came to an agreement. Here's the microchip. The password is “The sky is always blue over the statue of the Leader”. The man you need is Nicholas Page. He's a courier. Got it?</string>
  <string id="10452">Got it.</string>
  <string id="10453">Don't fail us, Evan! The New Tomorrow depends on you!</string>

  <string id="10684">I did it with pleasure</string>
  <string id="10685">I found him in a secret lab. He was tied up and asked me to get a scalpel and cut the ropes…</string>
  <string id="10686">And what happened?</string>
  <string id="10687">When I took the scalpel into my hands, I felt an irresistible desire to cut his flesh... It was like an obsession... I cut him, sliced him to pieces.. and I liked it!</string>
  <string id="10688">What are you saying, Evan?</string>
  <string id="10689">Hank, you have no idea how great this feeling is! I've been thinking about it for a long time, but kept driving those thoughts away. And then I got my lucky chance!</string>
  <string id="10690">Lucky? You bastard, you stabbed my brother to death and you call that luck!</string>
  <string id="10691">Hank, you have to understand - this feeling, it's wonderful!</string>

  <string id="10694">Hank, I have good news and bad news.</string>
  <string id="10695">Let's start with the good news.</string>
  <string id="10696">I found your brother, he's alive.</string>
  <string id="10697">Great Leader, that’s amazing news! Thank you, Evan! Where is he?</string>
  <string id="10698">Don't get your hopes up yet. I found him in Albert DeSalvo's cellar. Did you know that DeSalvo has a secret room in his office where he tortures people?</string>
  <string id="10699">What? What do you mean “tortures”?</string>
  <string id="10700">He ties people to a table and slowly cuts them into small pieces.</string>
  <string id="10701">Is that bastard torturing my brother? I'm going to kill him!</string>
  <string id="10702">Wait, Hank! You won't help your brother like that. You have to get him out of the torture room. I managed to convince Albert to release Rabindranath, but he demanded a replacement.</string>
  <string id="10703">That sick piece of shit! Let him take me, just get him to let my brother go!</string>
  <string id="10704">Are you sure, Hank? You’ll most likely die there, and it will be a painful death.</string>
  <string id="10705">I don't care! I'll do anything to save my brother.</string>
  <string id="10706">Give him the scalpel</string>
  <string id="10707">Take this scalpel. It's long enough that you could stick it into Albert's eye. Just be careful!</string>
  <string id="10708">Oh, don't worry! Just let me get my hands on the bastard! Thank you, Evan! I’ll never forget, not till the day I day!</string>
  <string id="10709">Try to make sure that day doesn’t come soon. Good luck, Hank.</string>
  <string id="10710">Wish him luck</string>
  <string id="10711">I hope it works out! I'm sorry I'm not helping you…</string>
  <string id="10712">You’ve already helped me, Evan. I'll handle the rest myself. Thanks for everything.</string>

  <string id="11114">That's not a lot of information.</string>
  <string id="11115">Wait, that's not all! He had to sign a couple of forms for me. I waited for him well into the evening, but he never showed up.</string>
  <string id="11116">What do you mean “never showed up”? Maybe he just went home?</string>
  <string id="11117">In the middle of the day? I doubt it... If you're interested, talk to the guards at the checkpoint or with the Shredder's technician. Maybe they know more.</string>

  <string id="11262">John, can I ask you one question?</string>
  <string id="11263">Sure, Evan.</string>
  <string id="11265">-&gt;$11264</string>
  <string id="11266">How do you mean? I’m John Smith, everyone here knows me!</string>
  <string id="11267">But the Ministry’s information system doesn't know who John Smith is, even though it contains information about every employee. It doesn’t have your age, personal history - nothing! How is that, John?</string>
  <string id="11268">Didn’t anyone ever tell you that wanting to know too much can win you a one-way trip to the Shredder?</string>
  <string id="11269">-&gt;$10147</string>
  <string id="11270">Stop trying to pull the wool over my eyes, will you?</string>
  <string id="11271">Diavolo! I told that cretino that this would happen... And now it’s happened! My name is Anthony Solerno, but my friends call me Fat Tony.</string>
  <string id="11272">Wait a minute! Are you that mafia guy who ratted out his accomplices and the whole of the arms and drug-trafficking network? Jeez, I read about you in the newspaper about five years ago. I thought you were sent to prison and shot!</string>
  <string id="11273">Wasn’t sent to prison, wasn’t shot. I told them everything I knew about the mafia, and in return they gave me a new name, got me into the Ministry and told me to wait until everything settled down.</string>
  <string id="11274">So are you here under a witness protection program?</string>
  <string id="11275">Si! They gave me a handler who was supposed to keep me informed, but I've been calling this cretino for two years now and the only answer I get is silence!</string>
  <string id="11276">So why don't you go find out what happened?</string>
  <string id="11277">I can’t leave the Ministry without identification!</string>
  <string id="11278">Wow!</string>
  <string id="11279">Evan, caro amico, you won't tell anyone Fat Tony's secret, will you?</string>
  <string id="11280">Don't worry, John... I mean, Tony...</string>
  <string id="11281">Fat Tony, per favore!</string>
  <string id="11282">OK, Fat Tony! I won't give away your secret.</string>
  <string id="11283">Va bene! Evan, could you help me? I want to know where my handler, that cazzone, has gone. I tried looking in the archive, but was denied access.</string>
  <string id="11284">I’ll let you know if I find anything out.</string>
  <string id="11285">You’d better get outta here, Evan! With your Authority, you’d be lucky to scare one of the office cockroaches!</string>
  <string id="11286">John. I mean, Tony...</string>
  <string id="11287">Yes, I’m sorry. I found out what happened to your handler. He’s dead and no one’s been working on his cases. Looks like they just forgot about you.</string>
  <string id="11288">Forgot? They forgot about me? Bastardo! Mascalzone! Canaglia!</string>
  <string id="11289">Alright, Tony, calm down.</string>
  <string id="11290">Fat Tony, per favore! You don't understand! They promised they’d guard my family too!</string>
  <string id="11291">So you do have a family?</string>
  <string id="11292">Madonna! Of course, every mafioso has a family! And I also have a wife and child. But I don't know their current address - those canaglia wouldn’t even tell me! Can you find out what happened to them?</string>
  <string id="11293">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="11294">Okay, I'll try to find something out.</string>
  <string id="11295">Madonna! Evan, you are a saint!</string>
  <string id="11296">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="11297">Well, yes, how could I forget... Sorry, I have a lot to do. The Supergame won't wait, and I don't want to end up in the Shredder.</string>
  <string id="11298">Evan! I’m begging you! Ever since I found out about my handler I’ve been worried that something has happened to my family! I’m out of my mind here!</string>
  <string id="11300">-&gt;$11299</string>
  <string id="11301">Fine, fine. I’ll help you. Where can I find their new address?</string>
  <string id="11302">Well, you found out about me somehow. How’d you do that, by the way?</string>
  <string id="11303">Let that be my secret, Tony.</string>
  <string id="11304">Do you always correct everyone?</string>
  <string id="11306">-&gt;$11305</string>
  <string id="11307">I have absolutely no time! Sorry, Tony!</string>
  <string id="11308">John... I mean, Tony...</string>
  <string id="11309">I found out where your family is living... Or was living…</string>
  <string id="11310">Mamma mia! Have they moved again? Did you see my Rosabella and Victor?</string>
  <string id="11311">I'm sorry, Fat Tony, but... There was a fire in your home, there was nothing left…</string>
  <string id="11312">All I found was this ring.</string>
  <string id="11313">Mio Dio! This is Rosabella's engagement ring! She never took it off... Mio Dio…</string>
  <string id="11314">Thanks for bringing it to me, Evan.</string>
  <string id="11315">I swear on the Madonna, I’ll kill whoever did this!</string>
  <string id="11316">But how will you get out of the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="11317">With your help, Evan. I’m counting on you, caro amico.</string>
  <string id="11318">But first I need to find out if those rats are waiting for me in the square. I’m sure they found out where I am and have already set up an ambush.</string>
  <string id="11319">How are you going to do it? How are you going to get out of the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="11320">Evan, caro mio! Have you checked the square? How are my old friends? Dead, I hope?</string>
  <string id="11321">Don't tell him about the mafia</string>
  <string id="11322">Apart from a pair of police trackers and a dozen onlookers, there’s no one there.</string>
  <string id="11323">It all seems too easy. The Mafia knows how to hide... Are you sure the way is clear?</string>
  <string id="11324">Absolutely sure!</string>
  <string id="11325">Va bene! Grazie, Evan! I'm going to get ready!</string>
  <string id="11326">I'll check again!</string>
  <string id="11327">My life depends on you, Evan.</string>
  <string id="11328">Tell him about the mafia</string>
  <string id="11329">I have good news and bad news. Which do you want first, Tony?</string>
  <string id="11330">Fat Tony, per favore! Start with the good.</string>
  <string id="11331">Your old friends remember you.</string>
  <string id="11332">Merda! What's the bad news then?</string>
  <string id="11333">A nasty-looking mobster approached me right in the square and offered me money to sell you out.</string>
  <string id="11334">Cazzo! And what did you do? You didn’t sell Fat Tony out, did you?</string>
  <string id="11335">Relax, I don't do that to my friends! But someone else might. They know almost everything about you.</string>
  <string id="11336">I need to get out of here. You said we're friends, amici? Then help Fat Tony one last time, si? I need... camuffamento... a disguise and a fake pass!</string>
  <string id="11337">Honestly speaking, I didn't check anything. I have things of my own to do, so I don’t really care! And don't come to me anymore!</string>
  <string id="11338">Evan, what happened? Why are you talking to me like that?</string>
  <string id="11340">-&gt;$11339</string>
  <string id="11341">Because you’re an office rat, just like all the others! And a crazy one, too!</string>
  <string id="11342">Evan, I’m your caro mio - this could end badly for you! You have insulted my honor…</string>
  <string id="11343">Your honor? Your honor doesn’t mean shit to the people who forgot about you here in the Ministry. So you’re just going to rot here under a fake last name - isn’t that right, Smith?</string>
  <string id="11344">My last name is Solerno! And nobody insults me like that!</string>
  <string id="11346">-&gt;$11345</string>
  <string id="11347">Whoa... I don't know what came over me... There's been too much going on... Sorry Tony.</string>
  <string id="11348">Sorry Tony, not yet!</string>
  <string id="11349">Evan, caro amico, could you find a disguise and a pass for me? I need to get out of here!</string>
  <string id="11350">Give him the things</string>
  <string id="11351">You’ll like my idea, Tony!</string>
  <string id="11352">Whatever you say, friend, whatever you say!</string>
  <string id="11353">Tony, this is your war. I won’t help you.</string>
  <string id="11354">Fat Tony. And that's your right, Redgrave. You’ve already done enough for me.</string>
  <string id="11355">Do you remember Rabindranath Wright? Hank's brother - he worked on this floor.</string>
  <string id="11356">Yes, I remember. He disappeared a month ago.</string>
  <string id="11357">Just disappeared?</string>
  <string id="11358">Well, yes. Just stopped showing up to work and that's it.</string>
  <string id="11359">Do you remember anything unusual about that day?</string>
  <string id="11360">Hmm... That day, I was hunting for clerks loitering around the paper tray. I remember the boss coming out of his office, looking my way and smiling. You know, it felt like he had seen right through me, despite me lurking like a professional... It was creepy.</string>
  <string id="11362">-&gt;$11361</string>
  <string id="11363">Yes, I don't remember anything unusual besides that. Just an ordinary day in the jungle.</string>
  <string id="11364">-&gt;$9256</string>
  <string id="11365">Inferno! He just didn't come to work, that's all.</string>
  <string id="11366">Do you know Hank? Can you explain something to me?</string>
  <string id="11367">What, old Hank told you to get lost?</string>
  <string id="11368">Yeah! I didn't say anything to him at all, but he…</string>
  <string id="11369">Don’t talk to him when he’s hungover. There’s no point - he'll either swear at you or come at you with his fists…</string>
  <string id="11370">How can you work with him?</string>
  <string id="11371">We just wait for him to get drunk!</string>
  <string id="11372">At work? That can’t be safe!</string>
  <string id="11373">Who cares? If he falls into the Shredder, that's his fault! But when he's drunk, you can at least talk to him!</string>
  <string id="11422">Hello! My name is…</string>
  <string id="11423">Evan Redgrave. 27. Married. One daughter.</string>
  <string id="11424">You’re well-informed!</string>
  <string id="11425">Nobody comes here without me knowing about it. I’m Rose Everdeen, Comrade DeSalvo’s secretary. Comrade Everdeen to you.</string>
  <string id="11426">I’m responsible for this department, its adherence to the rules and making sure it gets results.</string>
  <string id="11427">Nothing you do will escape my attention. Have you been given instructions about your new job?</string>
  <string id="11428">No, I haven't…</string>
  <string id="11429">Here we work with the citizens’ appeals that those imbeciles on the 1st floor have assigned to us.</string>
  <string id="11430">Read the instructions carefully. If you follow them to the letter, you’ll be seen as a good employee and enjoy a longer life than your predecessor.</string>
  <string id="11431">Come, I’ll show you to your workplace.</string>
  <string id="11432">Here is your workplace. The cleaner has the key - he was supposed to clean everything there.</string>
  <string id="11433">-&gt;$6088</string>
  <string id="11434">A nervous breakdown and an accident.</string>
  <string id="11435">Find the cleaner. He’ll either be by Comrade DeSalvo's office or near the Shredder.</string>
  <string id="11436">I have the key, Comrade Everdeen.</string>
  <string id="11437">Then open the doors and get down to business! Today you need to process 10 applications.</string>
  <string id="11438">I hope that you, unlike your predecessor, will be of use to the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="11439">Your job is to put seals and stamps on citizens' appeals. You’ll figure it out as you go.</string>
  <string id="11440">Hand over the workplace key</string>
  <string id="11442">-&gt;$11441</string>
  <string id="11443">Put a quiz team together</string>
  <string id="11445">-&gt;$11444</string>
  <string id="11446">Tell about Gloria Melfi's son</string>
  <string id="11447">-&gt;$6747</string>
  <string id="11448">-&gt;$6265</string>
  <string id="11449">Do you know what month it is?</string>
  <string id="11450">Yes! The Leader's Patriotic Quiz will be taking place soon.</string>
  <string id="11451">Several teams are taking part in the quiz, and one person isn’t enough. There are just 5 people between me and a brilliant LPQ!</string>
  <string id="11452">I already have one. Gloria Melfi signed her son up.</string>
  <string id="11453">I want you to find four more people for the team. Employees of our floor can’t take part in the quiz, so wander around the Ministry. If nothing else works, you can get someone from the street. Can you handle that?</string>
  <string id="11454">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="11455">I'll do what I can.</string>
  <string id="11456">I’ll be waiting.</string>
  <string id="11457">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="11458">Sorry, but I can't do that right now.</string>
  <string id="11459">Well, Redgrave, did you find anyone for the team? By the way, we've decided on the prizes - a set of books with quotes from the Great Leader and a travel voucher to the cities that he toured with his speeches! I wouldn't say no to them myself!</string>
  <string id="11460">Name the quiz participants</string>
  <string id="11461">Yes, I found some willing participants!</string>
  <string id="11462">Good job!</string>
  <string id="11463">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="11464">Evan Redgrave! I need you.</string>
  <string id="11465">Me?</string>
  <string id="11466">It’s about the Leader's Patriotic Quiz. Gloria Melfi signed her son up for the team, but he didn't show up!</string>
  <string id="11467">I’ve already issued a reprimand. But I’m worried about the evasive answers she gave me.</string>
  <string id="11468">I consider it unacceptable to poke my nose into the personal lives of my colleagues. But you, as the new person on the team, could benefit from getting to know your new family a bit better.</string>
  <string id="11469">Family?</string>
  <string id="11470">“Colleagues are a family! They are our brothers and sisters in arms! Faithful comrades in the journey towards a brighter future”. These are the words of our great Leader.</string>
  <string id="11471">Did you find out why Gloria Melfi’s son didn’t come to the quiz?</string>
  <string id="11472">Tell her exactly what Melfi said</string>
  <string id="11473">Gloria said that her son is a famous cellist and, as the person in charge of breeding new varieties of potatoes, he had to attend a meeting of the City Zoo's Ethics Committee. So he couldn’t come.</string>
  <string id="11474">What potatoes? What zoo? If Gloria Melfi is crazy, she needs to be removed from her position! Was she really serious?</string>
  <string id="11475">We work with documents! With the Shredder. It's dangerous! This is no place for crazy people!</string>
  <string id="11476">Confirm that Gloria Melfi was serious</string>
  <string id="11477">City Zoo. That's exactly what Gloria said. I didn't make anything up.</string>
  <string id="11478">We need to get her checked out. It’s dangerous to have her working here.</string>
  <string id="11479">Come up with a convincing excuse</string>
  <string id="11480">He’s a very busy man! He’s had so much work lately. He practically lives at his job.</string>
  <string id="11481">I see. I won't need to request his personal file from the archive then. That always causes trouble.</string>
  <string id="11482">Ask about the archive to find information about Melfi's son</string>
  <string id="11483">How do I request a personal file from the archive?</string>
  <string id="11484">The easiest way is to call from any phone - except your work phone.</string>
  <string id="11485">Don't ask about Gloria Melfi’s son</string>
  <string id="11486">It doesn't sound convincing. Everyone lives at work, and that doesn't stop honest citizens from participating in the Leader's Patriotic Quiz.</string>
  <string id="11488">-&gt;$11487</string>
  <string id="11489">How long have you been working as secretary to Comrade DeSalvo?</string>
  <string id="11490">I was one of the first whom Comrade DeSalvo called into service.</string>
  <string id="11491">What service?</string>
  <string id="11492">Service to the ideals of our state and the Great Leader personally, of course. May his health be unshakable!</string>
  <string id="11494">-&gt;$11493</string>
  <string id="11496">-&gt;$11495</string>
  <string id="11497">If Comrade DeSalvo orders it - I'll have a family. But now I don’t have the time - service to the Ministry is my whole life!</string>
  <string id="11499">-&gt;$11498</string>
  <string id="11500">-&gt;$9492</string>
  <string id="11501">Comrade Everdeen, how do you feel about Hank Wright?</string>
  <string id="11502">He’s useless when he drinks, and he’s impossible when he’s sober. But Comrade DeSalvo decided that Hank should be here, so I obey.</string>
  <string id="11503">-&gt;$10588</string>
  <string id="11504">What do you think of Gloria? Is she a good worker?</string>
  <string id="11505">Quite. Everyone chooses their own way to serve. My way is to help Comrade DeSalvo make our country great, and hers is to process papers well. So far, she’s doing fine.</string>
  <string id="11506">-&gt;$10597</string>
  <string id="11507">What do you think of John Smith?</string>
  <string id="11508">I think he's damn lucky. He’s already won in the Supergame several times because all his competitors died in work-related accidents.</string>
  <string id="11509">And that didn't ring any alarm bells?</string>
  <string id="11510">People are mortal, Redgrave, and some people become mortal very suddenly. It happens.</string>
  <string id="11511">-&gt;$9438</string>
  <string id="11512">What do you think of our boss?</string>
  <string id="11513">Comrade DeSalvo is the most patriotic patriot in our great Motherland after the Great Leader himself!</string>
  <string id="11514">Tell her that DeSalvo tortures people</string>
  <string id="11515">Do you know that your boss tortures people?</string>
  <string id="11516">Stop exaggerating! It’s just standard practice for increasing labor efficiency!</string>
  <string id="11517">Are pain and death “just standard practice”?</string>
  <string id="11518">Why death? I'm alive, aren't I? He showed me his collection, and one glance was enough to make me want to exceed my quotas!</string>
  <string id="11519">Ask about Arthur Mitchell</string>
  <string id="11520">Is it me or is our cleaner slightly wrong in the head?</string>
  <string id="11521">He has some minor memory issues, but it doesn't affect his work. And he doesn’t get in anyone’s way.</string>
  <string id="11522">Ask about the Ministry</string>
  <string id="11523">I'm sometimes amazed by how big the Ministry is. It’s just incredible!</string>
  <string id="11524">It's magnificent!</string>
  <string id="11525">Colossal!</string>
  <string id="11526">Unthinkable!</string>
  <string id="11527">-&gt;$14291</string>
  <string id="11528">Grandiose!</string>
  <string id="11529">Amazing!</string>
  <string id="11530">Divine!</string>
  <string id="11531">But Comrade Everdeen, there is no God!</string>
  <string id="11532">Who needs God when we have the Leader and the Ministry! All hail the Leader!</string>
  <string id="11533">-&gt;$8183</string>
  <string id="11535">Find out more about the Supergame</string>
  <string id="11536">Who came up with the Supergame?</string>
  <string id="11537">The Supergame was my idea. Comrade DeSalvo ordered me to find a way to increase staff efficiency, and I decided that the Shredder could do it better than any bonus.</string>
  <string id="11538">What’s the point of the Supergame?</string>
  <string id="11539">The point is simple: work better - and you'll live! After all, if you are of no use to the Ministry and do not serve our great Motherland and our Leader with all your might, then why do you need to exist at all?</string>
  <string id="11540">How do you win the Supergame?</string>
  <string id="11541">You need to score points before your rivals do. Points are awarded for processing forms.</string>
  <string id="11542">Who sets the goal?</string>
  <string id="11543">The quota is set by a Committee made up of employees from our floor, and takes into account the results of past competitions and the abilities of those participating.</string>
  <string id="11544">How can I get on this Committee?</string>
  <string id="11545">There are no vacant seats at the moment. All posts are occupied.</string>
  <string id="11546">Who is on the Committee?</string>
  <string id="11547">There’s the chairman, the secretary and three deputies.</string>
  <string id="11548">And who are these people?</string>
  <string id="11549">Me.</string>
  <string id="11550">And the rest?</string>
  <string id="11551">Chairman Rose Everdeen, Secretary Rose Everdeen, and Deputies Rose Everdeen, Rose Everdeen and Rose Everdeen.</string>
  <string id="11552">Ask about the Shredder</string>
  <string id="11553">Have you ever wondered what will happen if the Shredder stops?</string>
  <string id="11554">That's impossible! The Shredder hasn't stopped in the whole history of the Ministry. Perhaps even the building itself was built around it.</string>
  <string id="11555">Everything breaks eventually!</string>
  <string id="11556">No. That’s not true, because it cannot be true!</string>
  <string id="11557">And here’s Evan Redgrave! I’ve been waiting for you!</string>
  <string id="11558">Comrade Evan, your team won! You did a great job - keep it up!</string>
  <string id="11559">A motivational reward has already been issued!</string>
  <string id="11560">And the losing team has already packed its belongings and left the Ministry!</string>
  <string id="11561">Really? I didn't see...</string>
  <string id="11562">Why would you be looking in the Shredder anyway?</string>
  <string id="11564">Your team lost, which means your time at the Ministry is over. Your work will be transferred to another employee.</string>
  <string id="11565">Do you have any metal objects on your clothes?</string>
  <string id="11566">-&gt;$5706</string>
  <string id="11567">Buckles, buttons, clips? I don’t want you breaking the Shredder. Just kidding. It could turn a tank into confetti.</string>
  <string id="12213">Can I ask you a question, Rose?</string>
  <string id="12214">That’s Comrade Everdeen to you, Redgrave!</string>
  <string id="12215">Yes, sorry Comrade Everdeen! I want to ask about Rabindranath Wright - Hank Wright’s brother. Have you heard that he’s disappeared?</string>
  <string id="12216">Not disappeared, but maliciously flouted the rules of discipline!</string>
  <string id="12217">Has this happened before?</string>
  <string id="12218">No one who violates the rules discipline repeats that mistake again, Redgrave.</string>
  <string id="12219">Perhaps you might know what happened to him?</string>
  <string id="12220">The reasons are of no interest to me. As soon as he shows up, he’ll be fired on the spot. I guarantee it!</string>
  <string id="12221">Thanks, I guess.</string>
  <string id="12222">Back to work, Redgrave!</string>
  <string id="12223">Evan! Where have you been? You’re the only one we’ve been waiting for!</string>
  <string id="12224">And so, today I would like to formally announce a new round of the Supergame!</string>
  <string id="12225">To all the teams taking part - welcome!</string>
  <string id="12226">Team “Loyalty”: 1. Kyle Broflovski 2. Nina Krauz 3. Cedric Krazhevich 4. Fin Brom.</string>
  <string id="12227">Team “Homeland”:</string>
  <string id="12228">Scoring will begin tomorrow at the start of the new work shift. As usual, the team that does more for the good of the Ministry wins.</string>
  <string id="12229">And the losers will get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see the Shredder from the inside.</string>
  <string id="12230">Congratulations to all of you. Now get back to work!</string>
  <string id="15296">Evan Redgrave</string>

  <string id="11576">There are a lot more police cars in Helmer than ambulances, so they arrived for Redgrave almost immediately. The officers didn't deny themselves the pleasure of turning out his pockets, hitting his head against door of the car and throwing him inside like a bag of flour.</string>
  <string id="11578">Out of respect for his father's achievements, they didn't beat Evan with their batons in public. They saved that for when they were behind closed doors, back at the precinct. Redgrave, resigned to his fate, watched the scene with indifference, as if from far away.</string>
  <string id="11579">The fate of Evan Redgrave is unknown. His name has been lost among millions of similar denunciations, disappeared under thousands of multicolored seals, evaporated under hundreds of other people's signatures, vanished... His wife and daughter never learned whether he was shot, or died in the cold of the correctional labor camps along with thousands of other unfortunate souls.</string>
  <string id="11580">The death of Redgrave Junior attracted far less attention than that of his father. And who was he, really? Some even said that Caleb had no son, and that this petty upstart was an impostor who just wanted to get his hands on a ministerial apartment.</string>
  <string id="11581">The case was closed so quickly and the cremation carried out so hastily that it seemed like they wanted to get rid of him as soon as possible, like an annoying fly. Less than a month later, nobody even remembered that there had ever been a man called Evan Redgrave.</string>
  <string id="11582">Only his wife and daughter, who remained in distant Redding, remembered him. But they never found out what had led to such a sudden and sad end.</string>
  <string id="11583">A series of terrible explosions shook the city.</string>
  <string id="11584">The relay towers became colossal columns of flame, falling on residents' houses and destroying the streets below.</string>
  <string id="11585">Violent fires raged for several days, and when they were finally put out, the heaps of twisted iron and sad memories were all that remained of Project Heimdall.</string>
  <string id="11586">Over time, the huge relay towers became a familiar part of the urban landscape.</string>
  <string id="11587">Slowly turning rusty and useless, they hung gloomily over the heads of everyone below.</string>
  <string id="11588">And though some said that the towers were only slumbering, still waiting for their master, no one ever found out what they were really built for.</string>
  <string id="11589">A low, pulsating hum droned through the city, filling the air, boring into every mind and bending every single person to its mechanical will - men and women, adults and children, rich and poor.</string>
  <string id="11590">In just a few minutes, the entire population submitted to Heimdall's power.</string>
  <string id="11591">From then on, people thought, felt, wished and did only what was required of them.</string>
  <string id="11592">Little changed in the country.</string>
  <string id="11593">Ministers continued to fight over power, old players were deposed by new ones - each more vain than the last. A lack of principles became a synonym for success.</string>
  <string id="11594">Ordinary citizens remained a bargaining chip in political games, small cogs in the soulless machine of total surveillance and control.</string>
  <string id="11595">The desire for an abstract “common good”, embedded into the minds of citizens, had unexpected consequences. As it turns out, everyone has their own idea of “good”. And this meant that people strived for different, often opposite things.</string>
  <string id="11596">A wave of unmotivated violence swept through the city. People attacked one another at random, sincerely believing that they were doing it “for the common good”. When the wave of violence subsided, leaving behind it blood-soaked streets, the few survivors - shaken to the depths of their souls by the incident - started building a better world.</string>
  <string id="11597">And they did it with such fervor that they forgot about their own basic needs. After only a month, Helmer was a ghost town, where even the most desperate did not set foot.</string>
  <string id="11598">Is a cult of personality really such a bad thing? After all, if someone receives praise to the high heavens, doesn't that mean that they deserve it? The mindless worship of the Wise Leader was replaced by the blind adoration of Evan Redgrave.</string>
  <string id="11599">And if citizens had previously been able to afford to express their disapproval of the current state of affairs, even in a whisper, now no one would have dared to do so. Because having one's “own” thoughts is an unaffordable luxury in a country covered with relay towers.</string>
  <string id="11600">But this is not the end - it is only the beginning! There are still so many places in the world where Heimdall's towers are yet to rise into the skies, and so many countries yet to learn about Evan Redgrave.</string>
  <string id="11601">You can’t force a person to be happy against their will. But what if you forcefully give them free will? What if you instill in them a single thought: “From now on, you make your own decisions and take responsibility for your own actions”?</string>
  <string id="11602">Could it bring about peace? The inhabitants of Helmer were the first to become truly independent - even though their lives weren’t perfect, their choices were often far from ideal, and the consequences of these choices were painful.</string>
  <string id="11603">But they had their own choices, their own happiness and their own “mercy”. The ministers, all of them, were executed, the monstrous and useless bureaucratic apparatus was gradually dismantled, and the Ministry Building was turned into a museum dedicated to senseless cruelty.</string>
  <string id="11604">Luxury. Senseless and merciless. Marble statues, palaces and golden toilets for officials, Persian carpets, mountains of jewels and money, foul pools filled with champagne and caviar, monstrous orgies.</string>
  <string id="11605">The atmosphere of greed and a rotten system drowning in corruption. People stopped seeing anything wrong in it.</string>
  <string id="11606">The worship of one idol over another caused no kind of conflict - the signal from the relays took care of that. The Wise Leader was replaced by the Luxurious Leader - and no one noticed.</string>
  <string id="11607">It's scary when a real psychopath comes to power. And it is a nightmare if his power is limitless. But there are no words to describe the horror when this maniac gains control of your mind.</string>
  <string id="11608">In the hands of DeSalvo, Heimdall towers spread across the country. But they didn’t just force people to obey - from time to time, they transmitted a single emotion at full capacity - pure horror.</string>
  <string id="11609">Beside themselves with fear, people would increasingly hole up in the deepest crevices they could find, like mice. They had less and less time for anything useful. An atmosphere of impending doom, bordering on panic, reigned in the country for a long time.</string>
  <string id="11610">The relays quickly spread across the country. And citizens were processed into biomaterial to create clones.</string>
  <string id="11611">Copies of the “ideal employee” once known as Carl Stein replaced ordinary people - first in Helmer, then throughout the country, and then, step by step, all over the world. And next, the conquest of the solar system and the stars.</string>
  <string id="11612">A perfect, effectively-functioning world has no room for strife or war, hunger or injustice, love or compassion.</string>
  <string id="11613">Hemnitz deceived Evan unashamedly. With the relays at his disposal, he spread them quickly throughout the country and immediately carried out his plan to destroy the population.</string>
  <string id="11614">People dutifully lined up at the Euthanasia Centers. And when there was no one left, the Boreans came and took everything they needed.</string>
  <string id="11615">The once great country became a desert, with the frightening, empty streets of a ghost town.</string>
  <string id="11616">The ruling elite had no use for Evan. After the protective dome disappeared, he was held at gunpoint and thrown out the same window his father had fallen from.</string>
  <string id="11617">“Like father, like son,” they shouted at him in a mocking farewell.</string>
  <string id="11618">And only during that fall, in a state of absolute terror, did Evan truly feel free for the first time in his life. Even if only for a fraction of a second.</string>
  <string id="11619">Evan’s sacrifice wasn't in vain. None of the ministers who so passionately wanted unlimited control over the minds of the citizens were able to have it.</string>
  <string id="11620">Who knows how much worse things could have been if Heimdall had fallen into the wrong hands?</string>
  <string id="11621">But in the final seconds of his life, Evan still thought: “Could things have turned out differently? Was there ever any way for me to change something for the better?”</string>
  <string id="11622">Anyone who understood what was happening and who still had free will wisely fled the city, while Evan stayed on the top floor, witnessing the consequences of his choice day after day.</string>
  <string id="11623">Sometimes, in moments of weakness, he thought that punishing himself with the monstrous sight of the massacre below was enough to atone for his sins. But soon, there was no one left to whom he could repent.</string>
  <string id="11624">And so the thought of the Shredder, several floors below, seemed more and more attractive to Evan every day. But what mattered was that the thought was his own.</string>
  <string id="11625">Replacing the Wise Leader - is that not the pinnacle of a Ministry career? The name Redgrave was respected before, but now it inspires awe.</string>
  <string id="11626">Isn't that what you wanted for your son, father? Isn't that the greatness you dreamed of when you created Heimdall? Evan sits at the top of the world and everything belongs to him: from the mountains and rivers to the people and their thoughts. He alone decides what his subjects can feel and want.</string>
  <string id="11627">Evan Redgrave is a god now! And what does it matter that the fate of all gods is loneliness?</string>
  <string id="11628">Evan became a full-fledged member of the new society. When asked about what happened in the last days of the Great State, he would only smile and stay silent.</string>
  <string id="11629">He had no wish to recall his time spent in the Ministry, or the nightmares that he witnessed and took part in. Evan lost himself in real work and finally reunited with his family.</string>
  <string id="11630">Until the very end of his life, he tried to erase from his memory the faces of his superiors and colleagues, wishing fervently that he could stop hearing military marches in the distance and the roar of a thousand voices chanting: “All Hail the Wise Leader!”</string>
  <string id="11631">Evan no longer denied himself a thing. Luxury, wine, parties and girls filled the void in his heart. And although he always felt second-rate next to his boss, being God’s number two wasn't so bad.</string>
  <string id="11632">And all you need to do is abandon your own ambitions, bury the memory of your father and learn to shut your eyes to the problems of ordinary people.</string>
  <string id="11633">So let the champagne flow like a river, and may the music never stop! Turn it up louder! Let it silence the contempt that you feel for yourself at the bottom of your heart.</string>
  <string id="11634">Ferguson didn't appreciate the gesture. Of course, he gladly took control of the relays, but that didn't change anything for Evan.</string>
  <string id="11635">The boss didn't trust Redgrave, so he got rid of him as soon as he had what he wanted. Evan was accused of conspiring to overthrow the regime and arrested on the spot.</string>
  <string id="11636">The overzealous police officers, already under the influence of Heimdall's signals, beat Evan mercilessly, screaming: “This is for Ferguson!”. He was dead before the firing squad even arrived.</string>
  <string id="11637">Evan plunged into a world of boundless overindulgence. At first to satisfy his own curiosity, and then for the sake of entertainment - he brought an incredible amount of pain into this world.</string>
  <string id="11638">The apprentice surpassed his master: people started to fear him even more than they feared DeSalvo. And as soon as the new Leader realized this, Evan's career ended very quickly... Unlike his life.</string>
  <string id="11639">He would have been quite happy to die, but he no longer had the luxury of making his own choices.</string>
  <string id="11640">DeSalvo didn't appreciate the gesture. Of course, he gladly took control of the relays, but that didn't change anything for Evan.</string>
  <string id="11641">The boss didn't trust Redgrave, so he got rid of him as soon as he had what he wanted.</string>
  <string id="11642">Evan was accused of conspiring to overthrow the regime and arrested on the spot. The overzealous police officers, already under the influence of Heimdall's signals, beat Evan mercilessly, screaming: “This is for DeSalvo!”. He was dead before the firing squad even arrived.</string>
  <string id="11643">When the work was done and everyone, even his family, had been erased from his life, Evan shared the same fate as his boss.</string>
  <string id="11644">They passed away as equals, proudly looking at the fruits of their labor and leaving behind an ideal society that worshiped their images, preserved their bible and forever remembered Evan as a prophet beside the Divine Isaac Weinberg.</string>
  <string id="11645">Death did not frighten Redgrave, because he had accepted it of his own free will - unlike the millions of people he had deprived of the choice.</string>
  <string id="11646">Weinberg didn't appreciate the gesture. Of course, he gladly took control of the relays, but that didn't change anything for Evan.</string>
  <string id="11647">The overzealous police officers, already under the influence of Heimdall's signals, beat Evan mercilessly, screaming: “This is for Weinberg!”. He was dead before the firing squad even arrived.</string>
  <string id="11648">Evan wasn’t able to see it through to the end.</string>
  <string id="11649">He was only able to marvel at how quickly his fate had been decided, and regretted that Hemnitz didn't find enough soap for his rope.</string>
  <string id="11650">At least he wasn’t around to witness one of the largest genocides in history, and the destruction of his family along with it...</string>

  <string id="11765">Who you are? What do you want? Get out of here at once!</string>
  <string id="11766">Pete Ferguson, you are under arrest for the large-scale embezzlement of state property.</string>
  <string id="11767">What?! Do you know who you're talking to? I’m the Minister for Resource Allocation!</string>
  <string id="11768">And we have excellent records of how you’ve allocated resources for alcohol, women and other joys of life.</string>
  <string id="11769">It was during non-working hours! It was my personal money! This is my personal life, you have no right!...</string>
  <string id="11770">I have, Ferguson! I have the right and the proof. You dipped your hand into the state's pocket. You have defamed the official’s code of honor, not to mention the fact that you’ve broken the covenants of the Wise Leader...</string>
  <string id="11771">You will therefore be given a fair punishment.</string>
  <string id="11772">Who are you to tell me what to do?! One word and I will have you all shot! I'll....</string>
  <string id="11773">Enough! Take him away!</string>
  <string id="11774">No, don't you dare! Get your hands off me!</string>
  <string id="11775">Thanks for your help, Evan. We’ve had that weasel Ferguson on our hook for a long time, but we just couldn't catch him red-handed. He’s a slippery bastard... Was.</string>
  <string id="11776">Was? Is he...</string>
  <string id="11777">I don't know, Evan. It’s no longer my concern.</string>
  <string id="11778">So what should I do now?</string>
  <string id="11779">Request a promotion. When it gets approved, call me - I'll try to get you a better deal.</string>
  <string id="11780">Like make me a boss?</string>
  <string id="11781">No, Evan, you don’t just become a boss in the Ministry. I’m taking about floors. The higher the floor, the more important the position and the greater the risk.</string>
  <string id="11782">I’ve already come to realize that only the most cunning survive here.</string>
  <string id="11783">Correct. Don't forget to call me.</string>
  <string id="11784">Deal!</string>
  <string id="11795">Hi, Evan! I bet you were expecting the kind of low-rent affair a bunch of miners might put together, eh? Ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="11796">Pete Ferguson doesn’t do small - remember that. I spend a lot of time on preparations. For example, this time I thought long and hard about the theme of the party.</string>
  <string id="11797">And what were the options?</string>
  <string id="11798">At first I wanted to have a cemetery theme, but quickly thought better of it. Shovels, corpses, talking skulls and donkeys are, of course, funny.</string>
  <string id="11799">But we need something “livelier” for a party. Do you get it? Ha ha!</string>
  <string id="11800">Then I thought about a “Fight Club”. Picture it: fighting, blood, teeth on the floor, women squealing in delight and tearing off their clothes!</string>
  <string id="11801">Sounds interesting! Why did you change your mind?</string>
  <string id="11802">Turns out that no one here knows how to fight. The police only know how to beat people, and civilians only know how to lie there and whine about it. We already see that every day on our way to work, right?</string>
  <string id="11803">So today we're just going to party hard! A sea of alcohol, drugs, and Viagra in the drinks are bound to have some impact - someone’s definitely going to lose their shit, and we'll have a good laugh about it! What do you think? Do you like my idea?</string>
  <string id="11804">I like it</string>
  <string id="11805">It’s amazing! Very cool!</string>
  <string id="11806">You bet! Just wait and see - it’ll be mayhem!</string>
  <string id="11807">That's stupid</string>
  <string id="11808">You don't know anything about pleasure, Redgrave. A drilling war with your neighbor at the weekend is the most you can come up with!</string>
  <string id="11809">What are you just standing there for, Redgrave? Have a look around, talk to people, convince them to do something crazy. I want this place to get crazy, you know?</string>
  <string id="11810">What exactly do you want?</string>
  <string id="11811">Last year, three drunken strippers drowned in a bath full of red caviar. And someone confused the main safe for a portaloo, so I had to order a new one.</string>
  <string id="11812">The year before, we pumped some dwarfs full of helium and shot frozen chickens at them from a big slingshot. Ha-ha-ha-ha! We fed the people, so to speak!</string>
  <string id="11813">Just don't repeat our mistake by bringing a goat to the party. Those stupid animals don’t differentiate between bosses and the rest of the riff-raff. They headbutt everyone just the same.</string>
  <string id="11814">Anyway, Evan. I expect you to breathe some life into this party. Let's set this place on fire! You can take that literally, if you have to.</string>
  <string id="11815">Talk to someone else who can still put two words together, Redgrave! I want unbridled fun and wild laughter!</string>
  <string id="11816">Well, Evan. The party will end by itself, don't worry. Sooner or later, everyone will fall asleep right where they’re standing.</string>
  <string id="11817">Let's see how you got on.</string>
  <string id="11818">Good job! You hyped things up and did a lot of utterly shameful things that we can reminisce about later!</string>
  <string id="11819">Respect, man! I think I can trust you to organize the next party!</string>
  <string id="11820">Congratulations! You can safely say that you’re in good standing with Comrade Ferguson himself!</string>
  <string id="11821">You wasted my time and ruined everything! No one asked you to help those idiots! All the madness of the party was dampened by your miserable sanity!</string>
  <string id="11822">Go home. And remember, I don't like you! I’ll figure out what to do with you later.</string>

  <string id="11843">A dead young woman. How sad. I hope that’s what Ferguson wanted, or it was all for nothing.</string>
  <string id="11844">Hey, pal! Give me a light, eh? I stole a cigar from the boss's desk. I’ve always wanted to try one.</string>
  <string id="11845">Why are you all wet? And you smell like...</string>
  <string id="11846">Comrade Ferguson organized a contest called “Who can have sex in a barrel of whiskey?” Well, we won.</string>
  <string id="11847">Wow! How was it?</string>
  <string id="11848">Not as cool as it sounds. Everything is burning... everywhere... still... well, you know... But most importantly, we won and now we'll definitely get that promotion!</string>
  <string id="11849">Enough questions! I don't know about you, but I always want to smoke after sex. So will you give me a light or not?</string>
  <string id="11850">Advise them to wash</string>
  <string id="11851">I don't want to seem rude, pointing out the obvious, but... You’re both dripping with alcohol. Do you want to burn to death at work or what?</string>
  <string id="11852">What are you talking about, pal?</string>
  <string id="11853">If I give you a light, you’ll burn up. I mean that literally. I don’t know how else to explain that to two drunk people.</string>
  <string id="11854">Daaaamn! You're right! Thank you! Maybe we should go change our clothes at least.</string>
  <string id="11855">Give him a light</string>
  <string id="11856">Aaaaaaa...</string>
  <string id="11857">I wonder if this is what Comrade Ferguson meant when he said “Let's set this place on fire”?</string>
  <string id="11858">Do you know what to do with these pills?</string>
  <string id="11859">What pills?</string>
  <string id="11860">Comrade Ferguson gave us red and blue pills and said: “Choose between the painful truth of reality and the blissful uncertainty of illusion”.</string>
  <string id="11861">How did you manage to remember that?</string>
  <string id="11862">I just took some other pills before that. So what should we take? I really want Comrade Ferguson to notice us! Who knows, maybe he'll give us a promotion!</string>
  <string id="11863">Red (reality)</string>
  <string id="11864">It's time you came back to reality, guys. There’s nothing good here for anyone.</string>
  <string id="11865">He's right! We've been coming to these parties year after year, and there are never any promotions - only humiliations.</string>
  <string id="11866">That's true. Let's go home before we dance ourselves to death.</string>
  <string id="11867">Blue (illusions)</string>
  <string id="11868">It's a party, so have fun! Maybe you'll get noticed if you dance till you drop!</string>
  <string id="11869">You're right, damn it! Time for some energetic dancing!</string>
  <string id="11870">Dubstep! Now everyone will see who's the real b-boy here! Let's party till the sun comes up!</string>
  <string id="11871">Shove that contemporary shit back up your ass! Check out my electro dance!!!</string>
  <string id="11872">Electro was popular back in the 30s! Floss is all the rage now! Although I don't know what it is! Let's rrrroooock!</string>
  <string id="11873">Hey, Redgrave! Want to make a toast? Everyone’ll be listening. Here's the microphone. But it’s not free, you know.</string>
  <string id="11874">But Comrade Ferguson will definitely hear you.</string>
  <string id="11875">To the Wise Leader</string>
  <string id="11876">Let's drink to the one who makes all of this possible! To the one who tirelessly watches over us, everywhere and always, who gives us a sense of security and involvement in a great cause! To our leader, to the Wise Leader!</string>
  <string id="11877">You're such a bore! Making an official speech during the informal part of the event is so dumb!</string>
  <string id="11878">To Comrade Ferguson, the best comrade in the world!</string>
  <string id="11879">Let's drink to the man with a capital F! To the one whose work continues to break profitability records in a place where no profitability was planned at all!</string>
  <string id="11880">To the one who never ceases to amaze us with his incredible ideas and amazing parties! To the one for whom we would gladly die, especially dancing!</string>
  <string id="11881">To the one and only, inimitable, and unbe-freaking-lievably cool Comrade Ferguson! Hurrah!</string>
  <string id="11882">That was Evan Redgrave, everyone! Hey, Evan! Get your tongue out of the boss’s ass-crack and give me that microphone back!</string>
  <string id="11883">There’s no going back now. Nowhere to run. It's time to face the consequences of my actions.</string>
  <string id="11884">How could I have been so blind?! I should have known from the very beginning that they’d find a way to twist everything... Turn it all upside down.</string>
  <string id="11885">In their hands, every endeavor becomes an instrument of control, every carrot becomes a stick...</string>
  <string id="11886">This was all a mistake. All of it. But maybe it’s not too late to fix it! I need to shut everything down, destroy all the documents!</string>
  <string id="11887">Those empty eyes... That silent obedience... This isn’t what I wanted! It wasn’t supposed to be like this!</string>
  <string id="11888">To do great things, you have to overcome great obstacles. I know that, but still - I have never been so scared in my life.</string>
  <string id="11889">I'm sure they’re already planning on dragging Evan into all of this. I know of only one way to protect my son...</string>
  <string id="11890">Hello, Evan.</string>
  <string id="11891">-&gt;$9708</string>
  <string id="11892">My name is Albert DeSalvo. This floor answers to me.</string>
  <string id="11893">Nice to meet you, Comrade DeSalvo!</string>
  <string id="11894">Nice to meet you? Evan, we have different standards of niceness on this floor.</string>
  <string id="11895">-&gt;$12728</string>
  <string id="11896">But you’ll find that out in due time.</string>
  <string id="11898">-&gt;$11897</string>
  <string id="11899">Talk about a replacement</string>
  <string id="11900">-&gt;$9839</string>
  <string id="11901">Talk about the task</string>
  <string id="11902">Talk about the medical kit</string>
  <string id="11903">Talk about the book</string>
  <string id="11904">Talk about the victim</string>
  <string id="11905">Ask about the man in the cart</string>
  <string id="11906">-&gt;$6747</string>
  <string id="11907">-&gt;$6265</string>
  <string id="11908">Talk about the Ministry</string>
  <string id="11909">Can I ask you a question?</string>
  <string id="11910">Yes, Evan?</string>
  <string id="11911">You’ve reached some great heights in the Ministry. How did you do it?</string>
  <string id="11912">You want to build a career too? Commendable.</string>
  <string id="11913">I advise you to study human nature: its fears, the limits of what's possible, its weak points. This will help you achieve what you want and derive pleasure from your work.</string>
  <string id="11914">-&gt;$9422</string>
  <string id="11915">Comrade DeSalvo, is it difficult to control the Shredder?</string>
  <string id="11916">How would I know?</string>
  <string id="11917">Don't you give the orders? After all, everything here obeys you...</string>
  <string id="11918">Everything living, yes... But the Shredder is an unfeeling piece of metal that chews up everything that’s put into it. To make it obey, you just need to press a button. That's a job for the technicians - there's nothing of interest to me there.</string>
  <string id="11919">Ask about the torture room</string>
  <string id="11920">Comrade DeSalvo! When I was in your office, I accidentally noticed a strange room...</string>
  <string id="11921">Evan! Remember once and for all: do not enter my office without my permission.</string>
  <string id="11922">But there…</string>
  <string id="11923">It is my office and I decide what should be in there.</string>
  <string id="11924">But what about...</string>
  <string id="11925">That’s the end of the conversation, Evan. Goodbye!</string>
  <string id="11926">Ask about the Supergame</string>
  <string id="11927">I’d like to clarify something about the Supergame, if I can.</string>
  <string id="11928">The what?</string>
  <string id="11929">The Supergame among the employees on this floor.</string>
  <string id="11930">First I’ve heard of it. I have more important things to do in my office.</string>
  <string id="11932">-&gt;$11931</string>
  <string id="11933">Albert, do you mind if I ask you a personal question? Did you know my father?</string>
  <string id="11934">Oh, yes! Caleb was... a peculiar man. Too soft. Too smart. Too honest. I'm sorry to say it, but people like him don’t last long in the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="11935">Do you think that’s why he committed suicide?</string>
  <string id="11936">He was too concerned about others - that was his weakness. And weakness leads to disaster. That’s all I can say.</string>
  <string id="11937">Talk about Pete Ferguson</string>
  <string id="11938">So, Even, you recently transferred here from the first floor. How’s Pete Ferguson doing? Hasn’t he been shot for theft yet?</string>
  <string id="11939">I don't know him very well...</string>
  <string id="11940">That's good, Evan! Stay away from rogues like Ferguson. Head of the first floor is the limit of his capabilities, and you still have a career to build.</string>
  <string id="11941">Evan, I heard that you helped arrest Pete Ferguson?</string>
  <string id="11942">Yes, that's true.</string>
  <string id="11943">Words can’t describe how glad I am that the fat son of a bitch got what he deserved! They should have castrated that pig a long time ago! I’d personally cut his liver out if I had the chance!</string>
  <string id="11944">Wow.. So, you weren’t a fan?</string>
  <string id="11945">That’s giving him too much credit. I just wanted him dead, and that's normal. You’ll get used to it.</string>
  <string id="11946">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="11947">Evan, I have a request for you. I need a roll of plastic wrap and a roll of adhesive tape. Could you find some and bring them to my office?</string>
  <string id="11948">I can contact the Ministry of Distribution - they’ll deliver it in a couple of weeks!</string>
  <string id="11949">No, Evan, I can't wait that long. And I want you to do it.</string>
  <string id="11950">-&gt;$6661</string>
  <string id="11951">This way will be better. Go to the factory where they make the wrap. It’s near the Square of Carefreeness. Tell them that I sent you and they’ll give you the wrap.</string>
  <string id="11952">And the adhesive tape?</string>
  <string id="11953">If you can't find a flimsy roll of adhesive tape in the Ministry than what are you even doing here, Evan?</string>
  <string id="11954">Understood, Comrade DeSalvo!</string>
  <string id="11955">Please hurry! I really need them for some important business.</string>
  <string id="11956">Hello, Evan! Have you done what I asked?</string>
  <string id="11957">-&gt;$6277</string>
  <string id="11958">Yes, Comrade DeSalvo! Here is your wrap and adhesive tape.</string>
  <string id="11959">Wonderful!</string>
  <string id="11960">Can I ask why you need them?</string>
  <string id="11961">I’m very fond of arts and crafts and I don’t want to make a mess in my office. But let’s keep that between us, OK?</string>
  <string id="11962">Arts and crafts? That's unexpected.</string>
  <string id="11965">-&gt;$6705</string>
  <string id="11966">Not yet, Comrade DeSalvo!</string>
  <string id="11967">Hurry up!</string>
  <string id="11968">Strange that you cannot fulfill such a simple request. Hurry up, please!</string>
  <string id="11969">Is it really so difficult to do what I said? You disappoint me, Evan.</string>
  <string id="11970">I have another assignment for you.</string>
  <string id="11971">I'm listening, Comrade DeSalvo!</string>
  <string id="11972">Did you notice my collection?</string>
  <string id="11973">Of course! It's hard not to notice!</string>
  <string id="11974">I collect items that have some kind of historical significance. Dark significance! For centuries, people have learned how to hurt their own kind, and my collection contains almost every kind of tool invented for this.</string>
  <string id="11975">I’d have gone for butterflies, myself.</string>
  <string id="11976">Sorry?</string>
  <string id="11977">Butterflies. I had a collection of them as a kid. You take a butterfly, stick a needle in it...</string>
  <string id="11978">Oh, did you like to kill too?</string>
  <string id="11979">Kill? Erm... No, I just collected butterflies!</string>
  <string id="11980">There’s a reason behind everything in our lives, Evan...</string>
  <string id="11981">Albert, you wanted to give me a task.</string>
  <string id="11982">Oh, yes! I don't know how it happened, but my collection is lacking one very common item. Namely a medical kit.</string>
  <string id="11983">But why do you need it?</string>
  <string id="11984">Did you know that doctors have killed more people than all weapons and executions? I want one of those kits for myself. Ambulance crews have them.</string>
  <string id="11985">Are you suggesting that I take a kit from a doctor?</string>
  <string id="11986">I suggest that you fulfill my request, unless you’re ready to face some serious consequences. And keep your mouth shut, of course.</string>
  <string id="11987">But why me?</string>
  <string id="11988">That's how it has to be, Evan. You’ll understand soon enough.</string>
  <string id="11989">Evan, did you find the medical kit?</string>
  <string id="11990">Give him the kit</string>
  <string id="11991">It wasn't easy, but I did it, Comrade DeSalvo.</string>
  <string id="11992">Excellent! Give it here.</string>
  <string id="11993">And that's all?</string>
  <string id="11994">Oh, yes. Thank you, Evan!</string>
  <string id="11995">I didn't find it</string>
  <string id="11996">Still working on it, Comrade DeSalvo!</string>
  <string id="11997">Hurry up. I've already prepared a place for my new exhibit!</string>
  <string id="11998">Keep searching!</string>
  <string id="11999">I’ll try!</string>
  <string id="12000">Evan, last time you did a great job with my requests. Can you fulfill another one?</string>
  <string id="12001">I'm ready for anything, Comrade DeSalvo, but I need to work!</string>
  <string id="12002">And if you want to succeed in the Ministry, you have to do what your superiors tell you to, right?</string>
  <string id="12003">Of course, Comrade DeSalvo!</string>
  <string id="12004">So, a rare book called “The Philosophy of Suffering” has been brought to the city library. It describes torture in the 16th century. I really want it for my collection.</string>
  <string id="12005">Do you want me to steal this book from the library for you?</string>
  <string id="12006">Not for me, Evan, but for yourself. It might be of use to you, too - you’ll see!</string>
  <string id="12007">Why would I need a book about torture?</string>
  <string id="12008">You’ll understand later. Go get me that book!</string>
  <string id="12009">Evan, do you have the book?</string>
  <string id="12010">Give him the book</string>
  <string id="12011">Here’s your book. I flipped through it - our ancestors were real animals!</string>
  <string id="12012">But they knew a lot about torture. Thank you, Evan! I'll call for you again if I need anything.</string>
  <string id="12013">I haven't found it yet</string>
  <string id="12014">I haven’t gotten hold of it yet.</string>
  <string id="12015">It's good that you came, Evan. I have another assignment for you.</string>
  <string id="12016">Need me to steal, “acquire” or bring you something?</string>
  <string id="12017">Quite the contrary - I need you to take something and throw it away. See the documents in the cart? You need to throw them into the Shredder.</string>
  <string id="12018">But isn’t that the janitor’s job?</string>
  <string id="12019">These documents are confidential. I don’t want any outsiders seeing them, but I trust you. I trust you won't read them?</string>
  <string id="12020">I already spend all day looking at papers, Comrade DeSalvo. These eyes could do with a rest!</string>
  <string id="12021">Yes. Losing your eyes is very bad! And it hurts.</string>
  <string id="12023">-&gt;$12022</string>
  <string id="12024">Nothing, just thinking out loud. Go now.</string>
  <string id="12025">Comrade DeSalvo, did you know that there was a person in your cart?</string>
  <string id="12026">Is that so? And?</string>
  <string id="12027">Doesn't that surprise you?</string>
  <string id="12028">If he was tied up, then it’s just easier to carry him in a cart. It's logical.</string>
  <string id="12029">And I'm sorry, but I don't have time now.</string>
  <string id="12031">Hello, Comrade DeSalvo! Another assignment?</string>
  <string id="12032">Not this time. I’d like to talk to you, and a lot depends on this conversation. For you especially.</string>
  <string id="12034">-&gt;$12033</string>
  <string id="12035">What do you think I'm doing here?</string>
  <string id="12036">Supervising the second floor of the Ministry and everyone here.</string>
  <string id="12037">That goes without saying. What else? What do my collections tell you? And the tasks I gave you?</string>
  <string id="12038">You collect information about torture?</string>
  <string id="12039">I don’t just collect it, Evan. I put it into practice.</string>
  <string id="12040">You torture people?!</string>
  <string id="12041">Don't look so surprised. You've already guessed everything, I suspect. Yes, I torture people. You see, Evan, as people approach the limits of their pain threshold, they become more honest, more sincere, better!</string>
  <string id="12042">As if they have a choice!</string>
  <string id="12044">Agree to work with Albert</string>
  <string id="12045">It seems to me that it’s better to be your friend than your enemy. I will work with you.</string>
  <string id="12046">Wise answer. I think we’re going to get along just fine.</string>
  <string id="12047">What do I need to do?</string>
  <string id="12048">I’ve run out of torture material. We need to find someone so that we can get started. Can you handle that?</string>
  <string id="12049">I won't let you down!</string>
  <string id="12051">-&gt;$12050</string>
  <string id="12052">You torture people and want me to be your assistant? You are a complete psycho!</string>
  <string id="12053">No, Evan! This world has gone mad, and I'm just playing by its rules...</string>
  <string id="12054">Playing? So all this pain, all this suffering - it's just a game to you?</string>
  <string id="12055">Yes. And your words make me want to play with you...</string>
  <string id="12056">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="12057">Comrade DeSalvo, your proposal is very tempting, but I don't think I'm cut out for that kind of work.</string>
  <string id="12058">What's the problem?</string>
  <string id="12059">I'm afraid of blood!</string>
  <string id="12060">Yes, that is a problem. What a pity. Well... I hope it goes without saying that this conversation should stay between us.</string>
  <string id="12061">Don't worry, Albert.</string>
  <string id="12062">Why would I worry? It's you who’ll have worry if you talk. Nothing’s going to happen to me - I'm in charge here. Get back to work, Evan.</string>
  <string id="12063">I don't think that you can refuse.</string>
  <string id="12064">Albert, I found a man who might suit you.</string>
  <string id="12065">You? I thought we were going to do this together?</string>
  <string id="12066">Yes, sorry, “us”.</string>
  <string id="12067">That's better. Come on, I have everything ready! I have a couple of new tools and I want to show you how they work.</string>
  <string id="12068">Albert, I’ve fulfilled my part of the arrangement.</string>
  <string id="12069">-&gt;$7198</string>
  <string id="12070">About replacing that unfortunate person in your basement with someone else.</string>
  <string id="12071">And how did you manage that?</string>
  <string id="12072">His twin brother, Hank, will take his place.</string>
  <string id="12073">What a noble sacrifice! Well, I'll hold up my end of the deal too. You can go.</string>
  <string id="12074">Well, well, well… Who have we here?</string>
  <string id="12075">Redgrave? What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="12076">Me? I should be asking you what you’re doing here and what this all means!</string>
  <string id="12077">This is my relaxation room. Here I can relax and conduct some experiments.</string>
  <string id="12078">On people?</string>
  <string id="12079">Yes, I want to know the ultimate strength of the human psyche. I wonder how much pain a person can withstand before they agree to die.</string>
  <string id="12080">But enough about that. So, you’ve discovered my little secret.</string>
  <string id="12081">What do you plan to do now?</string>
  <string id="12082">Torture the captive together</string>
  <string id="12083">If you don't mind, I’d like to join you.</string>
  <string id="12084">Really? Why?</string>
  <string id="12085">I’ve always been curious... And what you’re doing looks terribly interesting!</string>
  <string id="12086">I'm glad that we understand each other. Shall we get started?</string>
  <string id="12087">Gladly!</string>
  <string id="12088">Free the captive immediately</string>
  <string id="12089">I plan to release this man immediately and leave with him! And when we get to the police, I’m going to tell them everything! You’ll live to regret what you’ve done here!</string>
  <string id="12090">Me? Regret? Redgrave, don't be a fool! Nobody will believe your nonsense. And even if someone does come here, which I strongly doubt that they’ll find anything. Believe me.</string>
  <string id="12091">You think you’re untouchable? I’ll do everything in my power...</string>
  <string id="12092">You know, Redgrave, I'm disappointed. I was hoping that you’d be smarter than your father, but you’re a weakling, just like he was. Get out of here and don't let me see you ever again. Or you’ll regret it!</string>
  <string id="12093">Negotiate release</string>
  <string id="12094">I want to free this man!</string>
  <string id="12095">Free him? Such naive kindness! And what do you expect me to do? Finding material for my experiments isn’t easy. So be it... Bring me a replacement and I’ll let your new friend go.</string>
  <string id="12096">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="12097">All right, I’ll do it.</string>
  <string id="12098">Excellent. But hurry - otherwise there’ll be nothing left to free! Or no one... What's the right way to say it?</string>
  <string id="12099">Grammar isn’t my strong suit. I think I should go.</string>
  <string id="12100">-&gt;$8996</string>
  <string id="12101">I have to think about it. This is all so unexpected...</string>
  <string id="12102">Redgrave, you must give me your answer now. It doesn't work any other way!</string>
  <string id="12103">Welcome to my humble abode, Evan! Here is where I conduct my experiments.</string>
  <string id="12104">Humble abode? Half the ministry could fit in here!</string>
  <string id="12105">Well, half the ministry is too much, but there’s certainly enough space for a few people. Come, I'll show you everything.</string>
  <string id="12106">Here is a beautiful 19th-century “interrogation chair”. This chair was used to torture traitors to our country long before you or I were born!</string>
  <string id="12107">Oh my God! There's a live person chained to it! Are you torturing him?</string>
  <string id="12108">What else would I be doing in here? You must have put two and two together and reached your own conclusions long ago - otherwise you wouldn’t be here.</string>
  <string id="12109">Understanding is one thing, but seeing it in person is something else...</string>
  <string id="12110">Stop pissing me off and pretending to be innocent, Redgrave! Let's continue the tour. So, the chair...</string>
  <string id="12111">The chair is perfectly preserved, Comrade DeSalvo!</string>
  <string id="12112">It is not only perfectly preserved, but also perfectly functioning! But let's carry on.</string>
  <string id="12113">This is where I watch how people react when I show them their insides. You should see the looks on their faces!</string>
  <string id="12114">Eww...</string>
  <string id="12115">Is something not to your liking?</string>
  <string id="12116">I just think it's not very pretty.</string>
  <string id="12117">Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, Evan. I hope you’ll soon see for yourself how fascinating it is!</string>
  <string id="12118">Comrade DeSalvo, is that the Leader?</string>
  <string id="12119">The “Iron Leader”, Evan! My pride and joy! A fusion of ancient art and patriotism! A harmony of form and content!</string>
  <string id="12120">-&gt;$7476</string>
  <string id="12121">One cannot escape the Leader.</string>
  <string id="12122">The Leader is in your heart.</string>
  <string id="12123">Inside, the Leader is just an ordinary, suffering person. You can come up with endless allusions!</string>
  <string id="12124">Ah… I see.</string>
  <string id="12125">Beautiful, isn't it? Well, let's get to the main course, shall we? Come with me to meet today's victim, Evan.</string>
  <string id="12126">And this is a Crux Decussata - a crucifixion cross. It’s great for stimulating long and insightful conversations on various topics.</string>
  <string id="12127">Long? I doubt that! I wouldn't be able to stand it for long!</string>
  <string id="12128">Evan, you have no idea what the human body is capable of in extreme situations!</string>
  <string id="12129">Well, here is our entertainment for today. A decent specimen - I really hope you like him. Want to start first?</string>
  <string id="12130">That's what I came here for!</string>
  <string id="12131">Excellent. Well, let's get started! Is classical music alright? I find that it inspires me.</string>
  <string id="12132">Fine by me.</string>
  <string id="12133">I'm glad we have similar tastes!</string>
  <string id="12134">Albert, you know... I’ve changed my mind. I can’t do it. This is... just awful!</string>
  <string id="12135">Explain…</string>
  <string id="12136">I can’t... It's just not for me…</string>
  <string id="12137">You disappoint me, Evan. Even more than that girl last week.</string>
  <string id="12138">Just imagine, 78 hours of divine pain and agony - we were going for the record! She just needed to suffer half an hour more. And then that bitch went and died at the most crucial moment!</string>
  <string id="12139">Forgive me, Albert... I just can't cross this line! I can’t make that choice. It's not right...</string>
  <string id="12140">I don’t think you fully comprehend what’s beyond that line. But most importantly, you mistakenly believe that a choice can be correct or incorrect.</string>
  <string id="12141">You can’t even imagine, Evan, how angry the very notion of “choice” makes me. It’s such an... ephemeral matter that it disgusts me to even speak of it!</string>
  <string id="12142">But our actions speak louder than words. So I want you to go to the desk in my office, find the remote with two buttons and bring it here.</string>
  <string id="12143">In and out, Evan. Or you yourself will be literally in and out of this room at the same time.</string>
  <string id="12144">I want to talk to you, Evan.</string>
  <string id="12145">I'm listening, Comrade DeSalvo!</string>
  <string id="12146">I’m extremely glad that I found a like-minded person in you. People like that are a rarity these days. I like your determination, your lack of prejudice, your composure.</string>
  <string id="12147">Thank you, Albert.</string>
  <string id="12148">Why, I almost fell in love with you! But you know what they say: “If you love something, let it go”. I want to give you a promotion.</string>
  <string id="12149">A promotion?! But…</string>
  <string id="12150">Don't argue! Yes, I’ll miss my hobby partner, but you and I both have to move on. I hope you’ll build a brilliant career in the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="12151">But why are you doing this?</string>
  <string id="12152">I can see the hidden potential in people. Sometimes you have to open up their chest to find it, but that won’t be necessary in your case. And so, I want you to move up and bring our philosophy to the masses from there, so to speak.</string>
  <string id="12153">I hope so!</string>
  <string id="12154">I also hope that when you rise to the very top, you won’t forget Albert DeSalvo, and that someday we’ll come up with many more interesting things to do in my laboratory.</string>
  <string id="12155">Thank you, Albert! It was a pleasure working with you.</string>
  <string id="12156">Good luck, Evan! And take care of yourself.</string>
  <string id="12157">Look! Everything is just how you like it! Two buttons on the remote, two cameras, two choices.</string>
  <string id="12158">What the hell, Albert?! What's happening?</string>
  <string id="12159">Do you see these people?</string>
  <string id="12160">Who are they? What are they doing there?</string>
  <string id="12161">No one. They're just strangers to you, and they are preparing to die, Evan. They just don't know it yet.</string>
  <string id="12162">And the girl? Are you going to kill a child? Albert, stop! You're crazy!</string>
  <string id="12163">Me? No, Evan. You are going to kill someone. Or save someone. The choice is the same, no matter what you call it.</string>
  <string id="12164">I'm not going to play your stupid games!</string>
  <string id="12165">Then they all die. But that’s a choice too, isn’t it? The “middle ground”. Just the way you like it.</string>
  <string id="12166">Why are you doing this, Albert?!</string>
  <string id="12167">So that you finally realize how horribly arrogant you are! Do you sincerely believe that there’s any kind of “choice”? That you can draw some kind of “line”? Well, great then! Imagine that the remote in your hand is chalk.</string>
  <string id="12168">Now draw that line, Redgrave.</string>
  <string id="12169">Refuse to make a decision</string>
  <string id="12170">I’ll have no part in this! I'd rather die myself!</string>
  <string id="12171">We'll get to that later. In the meantime...</string>
  <string id="12172">Save the child</string>
  <string id="12173">Damn you! Release the girl, Albert!</string>
  <string id="12174">But what about all these unfortunates? Will you just send them all to their deaths?</string>
  <string id="12175">I made a choice. As you asked. Release the girl.</string>
  <string id="12176">Well… as you wish.</string>
  <string id="12177">Save the people</string>
  <string id="12178">Let the people go, you damned psycho!</string>
  <string id="12179">How?! Don't you feel sorry for this small, defenseless, innocent creature?</string>
  <string id="12180">You’re a monster, Albert!... You’re a real monster!</string>
  <string id="12181">You’re sentencing this child to death, and yet I am the monster?</string>
  <string id="12182">Shut up already!</string>
  <string id="12183">Ech, how rude... Alright. These people will live. And I will take care of the girl personally...</string>
  <string id="12184">You're doing great, Redgrave! I think we’re going to get along just fine. And now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other things to attend to.</string>
  <string id="12185">You decided not to choose between two evils. So that your hands would stay clean, right?</string>
  <string id="12186">Like you didn't kill them, right?</string>
  <string id="12187">That's why people like me are at the very top of the food chain, why we are in power. Do you understand?</string>
  <string id="12188">Because single-celled people like you refuse to make choices!</string>
  <string id="12189">You’re no better than your snivelling father. You annoy me so much that I don't even want to cut you.</string>
  <string id="12190">I’ve called the guards They’ll take care of you. Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="12191">Choosing the child is a very emotional decision, Evan. You did not disappoint me, because we are here precisely for the sake of emotions!</string>
  <string id="12192">But by drawing a line for yourself, you let yourself down. A person with limits cannot develop.</string>
  <string id="12193">It’s sad, but this caterpillar won't become a butterfly. You are no longer of interest to me.</string>
  <string id="12194">As for the girl... We’ll let her grow up, lose her innocence... and then I’ll get to know her better.</string>
  <string id="12195">Very calculating and, I would even say, cold, Redgrave. Many lives instead of one.</string>
  <string id="12196">But you don't know them. Everyone in this cell could be a murderer, a rapist, a thief or something worse.</string>
  <string id="12197">But that is not important. You didn’t disappoint me. I think you still have a chance of becoming someone significant.</string>
  <string id="12198">The door to my “pleasure room” will always be open to you. Who knows, maybe someday you’ll change your mind and join me.</string>
  <string id="12199">Evan, go work and don't bother me.</string>
  <string id="12200">It was a pleasure to work with you, Evan.</string>
  <string id="12201">I hope that when you rise to the very top, you won’t forget Albert DeSalvo, and that someday we’ll come up with many more interesting things to do in my laboratory.</string>
  <string id="12202">Evan, the exit is the other way.</string>
  <string id="14857">You have already seen my secret sanctum, and you know what I do here.</string>
  <string id="14858">Yes, you torture people.</string>
  <string id="14859">Yes, I torture people. You see, Evan, as people approach the limits of their pain threshold, they become more honest, more sincere, better!</string>
  <string id="14860">There is always a choice, Evan. For you as well. So I want to ask you - will you become my assistant in my hobbies, or would you rather things went a different way?</string>
  <string id="14861">Think about it, this decision could change your life.</string>
  <string id="14862">Redgrave? Are you having in fun here without me?</string>
  <string id="14863">I was looking for this man. His brother asked me to find him.</string>
  <string id="14864">You’re not at my level yet, Evan.</string>
  <string id="14865">Bring his brother!</string>
  <string id="14866">You found him. Now what? What are you going to do?</string>
  <string id="14867">Happy to hear that, Redgrave! Why wait? Let's get started!</string>
  <string id="15094">I warned you that I didn’t want to see you again...</string>
  <string id="15095">You're a naughty boy, Redgrave. The guards will deal with you. I, unfortunately, don't have the time,...</string>
  <string id="15120">-&gt;$15119</string>
  <string id="15140">I thought all that stuff you said to me about torture was just a joke.</string>
  <string id="15141">This is no joke.</string>
  <string id="12231">I hope my bet pays off!</string>
  <string id="12232">Are you playing the sweepstakes again?</string>
  <string id="12233">Yes, it's a sure win! The Supergame ends tomorrow, and the department I bet on is way ahead of everyone else!</string>
  <string id="12234">How much did you put down?</string>
  <string id="12235">A month’s salary!</string>
  <string id="12236">THE SHREDDER IS A SOULLESS MACHINE! THE SHREDDER CANNOT BE A JUDGE! THE SHREDDER IS EVIL!</string>
  <string id="12237">Hi! Aren't you tired of standing here and yelling the same thing?</string>
  <string id="12238">LET'S STOP THE SPREE OF UNJUST VIOLENCE!!! MAKE VIOLENCE FAIR!</string>
  <string id="12239">And what exactly do you suggest?</string>
  <string id="12240">I demand that the Shredder be stopped! It is time to think about why a mechanism designed for waste disposal is being used to dispose of promising employees!</string>
  <string id="12241">Not all people are rubbish, just some of them! THE SHREDDER IS EVIL!</string>
  <string id="12242">-&gt;$12384</string>
  <string id="12243">Can you stop shouting for a second? Do you just want to yell about it or do you actually want to get some results?</string>
  <string id="12244">Get results? How?</string>
  <string id="12245">This floor has its own boss. Let's go to Comrade DeSalvo!</string>
  <string id="12246">Ha, do you think he’ll listen to my shouting?</string>
  <string id="12247">I am 100% sure that Albert DeSalvo will listen to every single noise you make with great pleasure. The louder the better.</string>
  <string id="12248">Seriously? Then let's go, of course! there’s so much I want to scream at the top of my lungs about!</string>
  <string id="12249">I can imagine.</string>
  <string id="12250">You think I don't understand that you’re trying to protect this soulless metal monster?! Why don’t you jump into this infernal Shredder if you love it so much!</string>
  <string id="12252">-&gt;$12251</string>
  <string id="12253">OK…</string>

  <string id="15279">-&gt;$15166</string>
  <string id="12254">What did you want?</string>
  <string id="12255">Albert DeSalvo, you are under arrest.</string>
  <string id="12256">Are you sure you’re doing the right thing? I am the boss of this floor!</string>
  <string id="12257">We know who you are. We’ve been watching you for a long time... We could have continued to ignore your... “hobby”, but you’ve crossed the line.</string>
  <string id="12258">You kill children!</string>
  <string id="12259">Nonsense. You have no proof!</string>
  <string id="12260">We have everything we need. Plus witness testimony.</string>
  <string id="12261">Witness... Redgrave! I knew you couldn’t be trusted! When I get to you, I'll tear your skin off, then I’ll rip your guts out, then...</string>
  <string id="12262">Take this psycho away!</string>
  <string id="12263">I'll cut your eyes out, Redgrave! I'll break every bone in your body! I am Albert DeSalvo! I'm the boss!</string>
  <string id="12264">Excellent work, Evan.</string>
  <string id="12265">I wish I’d never done any of this…</string>
  <string id="12266">I understand. That bastard crossed every line imaginable.</string>
  <string id="12267">What do I have to do next, James? The longer I work here, the more I want to escape.</string>
  <string id="12268">Our work isn’t finished yet, Evan. Just think, if this floor was home to a... specimen... like DeSalvo, can you imagine what’s going on up above?</string>
  <string id="12269">I don't want to work here anymore...</string>
  <string id="12270">Evan, the mystery of your father’s death goes to the very top of the Ministry. If you want to find out what happened to him, you need to apply for a promotion and move on up. Can you do that?</string>
  <string id="12271">Fine, James... But I just want you to know: this sucks.</string>
  <string id="12272">Where have you been, brother?</string>
  <string id="12273">You’re better off not knowing, brother. I’ve been through a lot.</string>
  <string id="12274">I'm so glad you're alive, brother!</string>
  <string id="12275">I'm glad too, brother!</string>
  <string id="12276">Hank, I apologize for interrupting your reunion, but you better resign as soon as possible and never come back here again.</string>
  <string id="12277">Let's go home, brother! We'd better quit and never come back!</string>
  <string id="12278">Let's go, brother!</string>
  <string id="12279">Thank you, Evan, we’re in your debt!</string>
  <string id="12280">Damn, it feels like this cart is full of lead, not paper. DeSalvo must do a lot of work!</string>
  <string id="12281">Look inside the cart</string>
  <string id="12282">What the... There's a man in there! He's still alive!</string>
  <string id="12283">Pull him out</string>
  <string id="12284">Hang on, I'll free you.</string>
  <string id="12285">Cover the person with papers and keep on going.</string>
  <string id="12286">So those are the kind of secrets DeSalvo has... Well... I'll keep that in mind.</string>
  <string id="12287">Carry out DeSalvo's order</string>
  <string id="12288">The less you know, the better you sleep! DeSalvo doesn’t look like the forgiving type, so it’s best to do exactly what he says.</string>
  <string id="12289">Thank you! Thank you for saving me!</string>
  <string id="12290">Who are you and how did you end up in there?</string>
  <string id="12291">My name is Fred. That maniac tortured me and decided to get rid of me after he’d had his fun.</string>
  <string id="12292">Get out of here before someone sees you, Fred.</string>
  <string id="12293">You know what your problem is, Evan? You’re artificially limited in the choices you have. Usually you have only three options.</string>
  <string id="12294">A “good” choice, a “bad” choice and something in the middle: something like “I have to think about it”.</string>
  <string id="12295">You’re like a pawn in a game where you can only move forwards and sometimes, under special circumstances, diagonally.</string>
  <string id="12296">But life is not a black and white chess board. Have you forgotten what kind of world you’re living in? Everything around us is in shades of the same color. Black.</string>
  <string id="12297">Bring me the remote, you arrogant son of a bitch. I'll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes and just how dark it can get!</string>
  <string id="12298">Comrade Redgrave. Comrade DeSalvo wants to see you.</string>
  <string id="12300">-&gt;$12299</string>
  <string id="12301">So, where’s the patient? Who’s the one whose bonus gave them a heart attack?</string>
  <string id="12302">That would be me, doctor! But I got better while I was waiting for you!</string>
  <string id="12303">Now that's just plain rude! We drove all the way here with this damn bag full of tools, and you just decided to get better?</string>
  <string id="12304">Take the medical kit using Authority</string>
  <string id="12305">Why are you talking to me like that? Do you want to lose your medical kit and spend your days in the Ministry’s medical center shoving hemorrhoid suppositories up clerks' asses?</string>
  <string id="12306">You probably think you scare me, right? That I'm going to start apologizing, asking for forgiveness?</string>
  <string id="12307">If only it were that easy...</string>
  <string id="12308">Well, you can go to hell! You can’t scare a doctor with your ass cheeks out! Here's your kit, take it!</string>
  <string id="12309">Wait, maybe I overdid it...</string>
  <string id="12310">Take it, I say! I'm tired! To hell with everything! Every ministerial brat tries to wipe the floor with me, and I’m supposed to make them better? No way! I'll become a vet and work with sheep - the same patients, but more peace of mind!</string>
  <string id="12311">-&gt;$9132</string>
  <string id="12312">DON'T YOU DARE STOP ME! I'm leaving!</string>
  <string id="12313">... What was that?</string>
  <string id="12314">Do you know who you're talking to?</string>
  <string id="12315">A potential future resident of the hospital morgue. So what?</string>
  <string id="12316">Offer to buy the kit for</string>
  <string id="12317">I'm feeling better, and I still have my bonus!</string>
  <string id="12318">And what of it?</string>
  <string id="12319">I can offer you a great solution! I give you the bonus, and you give me your medical kit! It's a win-win!</string>
  <string id="12320">Yeah, sure, right this instant! Do you know what will happen if I come back without my kit? I’ll get sent to the Blissful Sleep - no question about it!</string>
  <string id="12321">And if I add patriotism bonuses?</string>
  <string id="12322">Well…</string>
  <string id="12323">And a loyalty bonus?</string>
  <string id="12324">Is there such a bonus?</string>
  <string id="12325">Of course there is! So, do we have a deal?</string>
  <string id="12326">Ah, to hell with the Hippocratic oath, give me the money! I have three hungry kids at home... I'll say that some spies from Valverde attacked me... Let them look for this kit themselves. But if they find it, I've never seen you before in my life.</string>
  <string id="12327">Of course. You have a good day!</string>
  <string id="12328">And you stay well... ha-ha... I say that as a doctor!</string>
  <string id="12329">Yes, that’ll do. Take the bag.</string>
  <string id="12330">Maybe we can come to an agreement?</string>
  <string id="12331">You can come to an agreement with the coroner!</string>
  <string id="12332">-&gt;$11345</string>
  <string id="12333">Sorry, I didn't mean anything bad!</string>
  <string id="12334">Prick! You'll get a fine in the mail for making a fake call. Good day.</string>
  <string id="12335">A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Signor Redgrave.</string>
  <string id="12336">Who are you? How do you know me?</string>
  <string id="12337">It doesn't matter! My friends have asked me to make you a business proposal.</string>
  <string id="12338">Your friends? What’s this all about?</string>
  <string id="12339">We’ve heard rumors that you’ve showed some interest in the home of Anthony Solerno.</string>
  <string id="12340">How did you know that?</string>
  <string id="12341">Senor Redgrave, my friends are very generous and powerful people. They can pay well for someone's help.</string>
  <string id="12342">What do you want from me?</string>
  <string id="12343">We know that Anthony Solerno, or Fat Tony, is in the Ministry. We really need to meet with him to discuss an important matter. Get him to come out of the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="12344">I accept. I'll try to convince Anthony Solerno to leave the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="12345">Agree to help for</string>
  <string id="12346">Yeah, I could use a little help in the Ministry!</string>
  <string id="12347">It all depends on you, Senor Redgrave. I'll be waiting here for you and Fat Tony.</string>
  <string id="12348">I could always use some money!</string>
  <string id="12349">It all depends on you, Senor Redgrave. I'll be waiting here for you and Fat Tony.</string>
  <string id="12350">I refuse.</string>
  <string id="12351">As you wish, Senor Redgrave! We'll get to him anyway. We have a long reach!</string>
  <string id="12352">Who's there? Help! I beg you, get me out of here! I can't take it anymore!</string>
  <string id="12353">Who are you? What's going on here? What is this strange place?</string>
  <string id="12354">Rabindranath Wright! Enough with the courtesies already! Please get me out of here before that maniac comes back!</string>
  <string id="12355">Sure, sorry!</string>
  <string id="12356">Cut the straps, I can't move a muscle!</string>
  <string id="12357">Free him</string>
  <string id="12358">One minute. Don't move, I don’t want to hurt you!</string>
  <string id="12359">Torture him</string>
  <string id="12360">Is that so? And if I make a cut right here?</string>
  <string id="12361">AAAA! What are you doing?</string>

  <string id="12418">Hello! How can I help?</string>
  <string id="12419">Allow me to introduce myself - I’m Simon Valois, the manager of this wonderful building!</string>
  <string id="12420">Evan Redgrave.</string>
  <string id="12421">I’m very pleased to meet you indeed! How are you settling in? Is everything okay? Maybe you need some help?</string>
  <string id="12422">Everything’s fine! Although I wish the bills would come less often...</string>
  <string id="12423">Tell me about it! If it were up to me, I wouldn’t take money from my residents at all, but you know, work...</string>
  <string id="12424">I was just joking, Simon.</string>
  <string id="12425">Ha ha ha! I love people with such a fine sense of humor! I'm sure we'll get along just great! My wife Margaret makes wonderful cow tail aspic. Come visit us some time, it's my treat!</string>
  <string id="12426">Okay, I'll come by sometime. I’m sorry, Simon, but I’m pretty tired after work and could do with some rest. Was there something you wanted to ask me?</string>
  <string id="12427">Oh, forgive this old fool! I'll only take up another minute of your time! It’s embarrassing to talk about money, but all the tenants here have to donate to the Overhaul Fund as soon as possible.</string>
  <string id="12428">If you’re short on cash, then just give as much as you can. But the money is needed urgently!</string>
  <string id="12429">Ask about surveillance cameras</string>
  <string id="12430">Comrade Valois, I need a surveillance camera - can you help me?</string>
  <string id="12431">Sorry, but I don't use cameras. I trust people. I trust them! Trust will save our entire civilization, Comrade Redgrave!</string>
  <string id="12432">Donate the money</string>
  <string id="12433">Yes, of course, here you go!</string>
  <string id="12434">Thanks a lot! Sorry for bothering you! All the best! Have a nice day!</string>
  <string id="12435">Same to you, Simon!</string>
  <string id="12436">I would donate, but I don’t have that much.</string>
  <string id="12437">I just recently started out at my new job, so I only have</string>
  <string id="12438">No problem! Sorry for disturbing you! All the best! Have a good evening!</string>
  <string id="12439">Say that you have no money</string>
  <string id="12440">None at all?</string>
  <string id="12441">Give him all you have</string>
  <string id="12442">I rummaged through my pockets and it turns out that I have</string>
  <string id="12443">I'm ready to give everything for the building I live in.</string>
  <string id="12444">Oh, Evan. I will never forget your generosity! Thank you.</string>
  <string id="12445">I hope this is enough?</string>
  <string id="12446">I’ve only got</string>
  <string id="12447">Say that you have no money at all</string>
  <string id="12448">I just started my new job a few days ago. I don't even know what I’m going to eat tonight!</string>
  <string id="12449">What a pity! You won't be around here long if you don't have any money!</string>
  <string id="12451">-&gt;$12450</string>
  <string id="12452">That sounds suspicious. What do you mean “give as much as you have”? And why right now?</string>
  <string id="12453">Don't you trust me?!</string>
  <string id="12454">I don't!</string>
  <string id="12455">Why should I trust you? This is the first time I’ve met you! Do you have any kind of ID, by the way?</string>
  <string id="12456">How dare you! Everyone here knows me, down to the last rat!</string>
  <string id="12457">But I don't. So what about that ID?</string>
  <string id="12458">All my papers are in order! You’re the suspicious one! Wait right here - don't go anywhere!</string>
  <string id="12459">I do!</string>
  <string id="12460">I trust you! But you know what they say: “trust, but check you must!”. Sorry, Simon, but do you have any ID?</string>
  <string id="12461">You know, I thought better of you. I’ll go get my papers and then you’ll feel ashamed of your words and deeds. And to think that I was going to treat you to some of my aspic...</string>
  <string id="12462">-&gt;$11345</string>
  <string id="12463">Sorry, Simon, you can’t be too careful these days. Of course I’ll donate money to the fund!</string>
  <string id="12464">Here, take it!</string>
  <string id="12465">No problem! Sorry for disturbing you! All the best! Have a good day!</string>
  <string id="12466">Don't apologize</string>
  <string id="12467">I don't like “aspic”. And in this country, we call it “jelly”!</string>
  <string id="12468">I know what my wife cooks better than you do! So, you need my documents?</string>
  <string id="12469">I’d like to see them.</string>
  <string id="12470">Wait here and don't go anywhere! I'll come back with the inspectors, and believe me, then you will regret insulting me!</string>
  <string id="12471">Good evening!</string>
  <string id="12472">My name is Casper Pullman. I’m the manager of this building. Here’s my ID.</string>
  <string id="12473">My name is Evan Redgrave and I’ve already talked to the manager... What was his name... Simon Valois!</string>
  <string id="12474">Simon Valois? That old drunk from the third floor, a manager?</string>
  <string id="12475">That’s what he said!</string>
  <string id="12476">And he probably asked you for money?</string>
  <string id="12477">Yes. For the overhaul fund.</string>
  <string id="12478">That scoundrel! If you see him again, chase him away and let me know. I'll deal with him!</string>
  <string id="12479">I didn't know. Thanks for the warning!</string>
  <string id="12480">But let's get down to business. As the building manager, I have to familiarize you with the rules of tenancy.</string>
  <string id="12481">I don't have time</string>
  <string id="12482">Sorry, but I don't have time right now.</string>
  <string id="12483">You’re taking a risk, Evan. You'll get a fine and warning in your personal file for refusing instructions!</string>
  <string id="12484">Fine, I'll find some time for you.</string>
  <string id="12485">I've been threatened with worse before.</string>
  <string id="12486">Casper, I said that I don't have time. That means that I’m not going to talk to you. Complain to whoever you want! Good day!</string>
  <string id="12488">-&gt;$12487</string>
  <string id="12489">-&gt;$12033</string>
  <string id="12490">So, Evan. You live in a building for civil servants. It is forbidden make noise, litter, keep pets and lock the doors.</string>
  <string id="12491">Lock the doors?</string>
  <string id="12492">Well how else can I check that you’re following these rules?</string>
  <string id="12493">-&gt;$13285</string>
  <string id="12494">So, there are about 150 points here, but I can see that you’re an intelligent person and can read them yourself. By the way, you will face immediate eviction if you break the rules.</string>
  <string id="12495">I understand.</string>
  <string id="12496">And don't forget to pay your bills!</string>
  <string id="12497">And turn off the tap!</string>
  <string id="12498">And switch off the lights!</string>
  <string id="12499">Comrade Pullman, I need a surveillance camera. Can you help me?</string>
  <string id="12500">What do you need a camera for? I don’t have any cameras!</string>
  <string id="12502">-&gt;$12501</string>
  <string id="12503">Come on! Everyone knows that managers have cameras. This building is full of them!</string>
  <string id="12504">I’ll sell you a camera, Comrade Redgrave, but you have to keep your mouth shut! Not everyone is as knowledgeable as you!</string>
  <string id="12505">Don't spread panic among your neighbors!</string>
  <string id="12506">-&gt;$11083</string>
  <string id="12507">This camera is top-notch. The picture is very clear, and it even has automatic focus!</string>
  <string id="12508">-&gt;$14408</string>
  <string id="12509">Come back to me when you have the money.</string>
  <string id="12510">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="12511">Flatter him</string>
  <string id="12512">I don't believe that such an exemplary manager as you has no cameras! They’re the foundation of security!</string>
  <string id="12513">I’m glad you understand that, Comrade Redgrave! It's a pleasure dealing with you. I can sell you a camera at a cost.</string>
  <string id="12514">-&gt;$6265</string>
  <string id="12515">Goodbye!</string>
  <string id="12516">Ask what's going on here</string>
  <string id="12517">What are you doing in my apartment?</string>
  <string id="12518">Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm leaving.</string>
  <string id="12519">Get out of here right now!</string>
  <string id="12520">Hello, Evan! I don’t suppose you’ve seen your downstairs neighbor’s cat, have you? White, fluffy, affectionate?</string>
  <string id="12521">But the rules don't allow pets?</string>
  <string id="12522">You’re not easily fooled...</string>
  <string id="12523">-&gt;$6658</string>
  <string id="12524">Can I trust you?</string>
  <string id="12525">Decide that for yourself!</string>
  <string id="12526">You look reliable... I suspect that your downstairs neighbor has a cat.</string>
  <string id="12527">I got that part. But you can enter any apartment, right? Can't you check?</string>
  <string id="12528">I’ve checked many times! But he hides it well. Anyway, Evan, I just need a witness to say that they saw the cat.</string>
  <string id="12529">Why do you need one?</string>
  <string id="12530">Again, strictly between us... I have a friend who’s ready to pay twice as much for the apartment. And if you help me, I’ll lower your rent! I give you my word. So, have you seen your neighbor's cat?</string>
  <string id="12531">But is there really a cat?</string>
  <string id="12532">Definitely! I swear on my mother's life! I heard it meowing myself!</string>
  <string id="12533">I haven't seen it</string>
  <string id="12534">Sorry, Casper, but I can’t lie. I haven't seen any cats, unfortunately.</string>
  <string id="12535">Are you sure, Evan? Think hard about whether you want to live in this apartment happily and for a long time.</string>
  <string id="12536">Yes, I’m sure.</string>
  <string id="12537">Well... I’d thought more highly of you Farewell. Something tells me that we’ll meet soon under less pleasant circumstances.</string>
  <string id="12538">Always glad to see you, Casper!</string>
  <string id="12539">I saw it</string>
  <string id="12540">Okay, I’ll help you!</string>
  <string id="12541">Great, Evan! I knew I could count on you! I’ve already prepared everything. Sign here to attest that you’ve seen the cat with your own eyes... Yes... Thank you so much!</string>
  <string id="12542">And what about...</string>
  <string id="12543">Everything in due course, Evan!</string>
  <string id="12544">Hello, Evan! Have you heard anything about the patriotic lottery?</string>
  <string id="12545">“Buy a Ticket - Kill a Borean”? Yes, I read about it in the newspapers. What about it?</string>
  <string id="12546">We decided to buy tickets for the whole building. Are you in?</string>
  <string id="12547">What will you do with the winnings?</string>
  <string id="12548">With the what now?</string>
  <string id="12549">It’s a lottery, shouldn't there be prizes?</string>
  <string id="12550">Ah, that... There’s a certain amount due - we’ll split it evenly. But we’re not doing it for the money, we want to support the Wise Leader! So, are you with us? We’re collecting</string>
  <string id="12551">Agree to participate</string>
  <string id="12552">Yes, here's the money!</string>
  <string id="12553">Excellent! I knew you were a true patriot!</string>
  <string id="12554">Don't forget about it if the ticket wins!</string>
  <string id="12555">Young man! Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country!</string>
  <string id="12556">Well said. Did the Great Leader say that?</string>
  <string id="12557">No, some guy called Kennedy. But you don't know him - he's not from Helmer. I won't waste any more of your time!</string>
  <string id="12558">What?! You don't want to help our country? Are you not a patriot?</string>
  <string id="12559">I am a patriot. But I don’t have the money for the tickets.</string>
  <string id="12560">Very well. I’ll note this in my report. I did not expect this kind of behavior from you, Evan. Watch out - you’re on thin ice!</string>
  <string id="12561">Are you threatening me?</string>
  <string id="12562">Of course not! I’m just letting you know that there may be consequences, and you’re still so young... A real pity...</string>
  <string id="12564">-&gt;$12563</string>
  <string id="12565">I am a patriot. But I don't want to buy tickets.</string>
  <string id="14919">Good evening! I have great news! The lottery ticket that I bought with the money donated by tenants won!</string>
  <string id="14920">Great!</string>
  <string id="14921">As the originator of this idea, I took a fair amount for myself and split the rest among you all! Here’s your share.</string>
  <string id="14922">Thanks! This is very unexpected!</string>
  <string id="14923">Oh yes. This is the 16th time I’ve taken part in the lottery, and my first major prize.</string>
  <string id="14924">Why are you telling me this? I didn't donate any money...</string>
  <string id="14925">To make you understand that you cannot break away from the group! It can end badly!</string>
  <string id="12566">Hello! Are you Evan?</string>
  <string id="12567">Yes. What's the matter?</string>
  <string id="12568">My name is Harry Weiss, I am your neighbor from the apartment below. I wanted to thank you for not giving me and my Missy away to the building manager.</string>
  <string id="12569">Missy? What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="12570">Missy is my cat.</string>
  <string id="12571">So she does exist?</string>
  <string id="12572">Yes. You see, I have no one left except her.... My wife was sick for a long time, and one day I was coming home from the hospital and came across a kitten on the street. I don’t really know why, but I decided to take it... I got a telling off from the wife for that - said that I’d be kicked out of the apartment, and the next morning I found out that she was dead. That kitten was the last thing I told her about. I named the kitten after her...</string>
  <string id="12573">I'm very sorry to hear that, Harry.</string>
  <string id="12574">Missy is very smart! She hides from the manager when he comes in on his checks. Doesn't mew, doesn't make any noise. Just purrs. She’s the only joy I have, you know?</string>
  <string id="12575">I understand. But what do you want from me?</string>
  <string id="12576">Oh, I don’t want anything, just.. It's so rare to meet a good person these days, and I thought that I should thank you. Here, take this.</string>
  <string id="12577">What is it?</string>
  <string id="12578">These are some warm socks made from Missy's fur. They help with rheumatism and pain in the legs. Knitting is my hobby, you know.</string>
  <string id="12579">Actually... No. I could use the socks myself! I’ll give you some money instead.</string>
  <string id="12580">Accept the gift</string>
  <string id="12581">Thanks, Harry, but you really didn't need to.</string>
  <string id="12582">Take it! I mean it! Thanks again! Goodbye!</string>
  <string id="12583">Refuse the gift</string>
  <string id="12584">Don’t take this the wrong way, Harry, but I can’t accept this. You could use the money yourself.</string>
  <string id="12585">Then take this book!</string>
  <string id="12586">-&gt;$9203</string>
  <string id="12587">It’s an amateur electrician’s encyclopedia. You might come across something useful in there. I don’t need it anyway -they cut my electricity off when I stopped paying for it.</string>
  <string id="12588">I don't need anything</string>
  <string id="12589">I don’t know anything about electricity and I’m afraid to even look at wall sockets, so sorry, Harry, but no. It cost me nothing to help you, so a simple “thank you” is more than enough!</string>
  <string id="12590">Evan, I am in your debt, and if you ever need anything...</string>
  <string id="12591">Harry, go back to Missy. She probably misses you already!</string>
  <string id="12592">Thank you, Evan! You’re a good man!</string>
  <string id="12593">Take the book</string>
  <string id="12594">Well, if you insist, I'll take the book.</string>
  <string id="12595">Thanks again, Evan!</string>
  <string id="12596">Good luck with Missy! And don't get caught by the manager!</string>
  <string id="12597">I'll try!</string>

  <string id="12976">About the prototype? Why do you ask?</string>
  <string id="12977">Weinberg asked me to find out. He’s having some difficulties with the firmware.</string>
  <string id="12978">I read in the documents that they tested some experimental anti-sleep drug on the prototype.</string>
  <string id="12979">Did it somehow affect the clones?</string>
  <string id="12980">I don't know, but the clones have a good resistance to all medication and are great for testing drugs on.</string>
  <string id="12981">Thanks! I hope this information will be useful.</string>

  <string id="12983">Diversity quotas. I have a disability.</string>

  <string id="12987">The blood vessels in my head are shot. Ever heard of an aneurysm? The Ministry of Social Care sets aside a few places for people like me - smart, but weak in the head. This is a welfare state after all, right, Evan?</string>
  <string id="12988">-&gt;$8047</string>
  <string id="12989">So, in a way, I’m the personification of this state - I have a blood clot in my head, but also a job.</string>

  <string id="12991">It could be worse. Though every year I have to go to the bureaucrats and prove to them that a miracle hasn’t happened yet.</string>

  <string id="12994">These idiots recently moved the department of information from the Ministry to the other end of the town. On the twelfth floor, no less.</string>
  <string id="12995">That must be inconvenient!</string>
  <string id="12996">Inconvenient? Those stairs will be the death of me! Maybe you could go and get the certificate for me? It should only take about half an hour. Or do you not want to help a disabled man?</string>
  <string id="12997">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="12998">Of course I'll help - it's no problem for me!</string>
  <string id="12999">I'll give you the address of the Certificates Office. Thank you in advance!</string>
  <string id="13000">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="13001">I can't help you right now. Maybe another time.</string>
  <string id="13002">Yes of course, disabled people live forever after all...</string>
  <string id="13003">I brought you a quota certificate!</string>
  <string id="13004">About time! I've already been summoned to the personnel department! Give it here!</string>
  <string id="13005">They wanted to send you for treatment, but I refused because you didn't ask for it. Maybe I shouldn't have?</string>
  <string id="13006">Treatment, you say? The way they treat people, I’d rather suffer my whole life!</string>
  <string id="13007">Thank you, Evan! Did it cost you much? Tell me, I'll pay!</string>
  <string id="13008">It cost</string>
  <string id="13009">Just</string>
  <string id="13010">Here, take it! The certificate is more important!</string>
  <string id="13011">I had to give them a fiver to skip the line.</string>
  <string id="13012">Well, that's not a godly amount. Although there is no god, otherwise I would not have to collect these papers. Here you go!</string>
  <string id="13013">I don't need anything</string>
  <string id="13014">I have a travel card, so I didn't spend a thing.</string>
  <string id="13015">Of course! One has to enjoy the benefits that the state provides, right?</string>
  <string id="13016">-&gt;$8183</string>
  <string id="13017">Of course, of course!</string>
  <string id="13018">And why do you need these quotas, certificates, bureaucracy? Aren't you eligible for some kind of allowance?</string>
  <string id="13019">You think I'm here for the money?</string>
  <string id="13020">What else?</string>
  <string id="13021">Eh... Okay. You look like a reliable guy...</string>
  <string id="13022">Have you heard anything about the chemical factory in the suburbs?</string>
  <string id="13023">The one you’re not supposed to go anywhere near?</string>
  <string id="13024">That’s the one. I was born in the suburbs. When the factory was built there, they surrounded the entire village with barbed wire so that no one could tell people about all the emissions the factory produced.</string>
  <string id="13025">That's how I got my aneurysm and disability.</string>
  <string id="13026">But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise! My disability helped me get this job and now I can get drugs, surgical tools and even transplants!</string>
  <string id="13027">But why?</string>
  <string id="13028">People are dying in the suburbs, Evan.</string>
  <string id="13029">Once a week I bring them cloned organs, medications, and dressings. I perform surgeries. They have no other medicine.</string>
  <string id="13030">What do you think is better, Evan - recycling unwanted organs in the Shredder or helping people?</string>
  <string id="13031">I wanted to talk about the Suburbs.</string>
  <string id="13032">Offer help</string>
  <string id="13033">Is there any way I can help fix the situation?</string>
  <string id="13034">Do you have the Novichok antidote?</string>
  <string id="13036">-&gt;$13035</string>
  <string id="13037">Can you stop the chemical factory?</string>
  <string id="13038">-&gt;$7690</string>
  <string id="13039">Maybe you can convince the boss to send organs to the village officially?</string>
  <string id="13040">Not likely!</string>
  <string id="13041">Then how can you help me?</string>
  <string id="13042">I don't know yet, Stephen, but I’ll try!</string>
  <string id="13043">Let's talk about it another time.</string>
  <string id="13044">Stephen, I have good news!</string>
  <string id="13045">Let me guess... They introduced a tax on socks with holes? Banned rain drops from falling on us from the sky? Do we have to blow our noses in strict accordance with an official timetable?</string>
  <string id="13046">You’re funny. No, I went to get your certificate and it just so happened that they suddenly got some extra places for treatment. I managed to sign you up! You’re going to get better, Stephen!</string>
  <string id="13047">Treatment? What treatment? Are you crazy?</string>
  <string id="13048">Stephen, I thought it would be better that way!</string>
  <string id="13049">What kind of moron are you, Evan? Who asked you to do this? What am I supposed to do now?</string>
  <string id="13050">Be happy!</string>
  <string id="13051">Go to hell! You’ve ruined everything!</string>
  <string id="13052">-&gt;$10737</string>
  <string id="13053">Stephen, don’t get so worked up. You have weak blood vessels as it is! What did I ruin?</string>
  <string id="13054">Do you want the truth? You’ve doomed hundreds of people to their deaths with this piece of paper!</string>
  <string id="13055">What?! What are you saying? They nearly tore my legs off for this piece of paper and tried to stab me in the eye with a pen.</string>
  <string id="13056">It would have been better if they had!</string>
  <string id="13057">This is what I get for helping people!</string>
  <string id="13058">-&gt;$12377</string>
  <string id="13059">This is what I get for helping people! You want to do what's best, and in return...</string>
  <string id="13061">-&gt;$13060</string>
  <string id="13062">Yeah, right... “go to hell!” You’re not a nice person, Stephen. I'd better leave.</string>
  <string id="13063">Stephen, what if we think of a way to help these people together?</string>
  <string id="13064">Do you think that just because I have an aneurysm, I can't use my brain? You are very much mistaken!</string>
  <string id="13065">And what have you come up with?</string>
  <string id="13066">I have some ideas. But I can’t do it alone.</string>
  <string id="13067">Ask about options for helping people in the Suburbs</string>
  <string id="13068">What are the options?</string>
  <string id="13069">I see three of them: get the Novichok antidote, arrange official deliveries of organs and medicine, or just shut the factory down somehow.</string>
  <string id="13070">Ask about the Novichok antidote</string>
  <string id="13071">Tell me about Novichok.</string>
  <string id="13072">It’s a special drug - the latest secret development. It triggers tissue regeneration in all living beings. The effect is colossal! And Novichok was tested on people - Weinberg didn't want to use Carls.</string>
  <string id="13073">How can we get it?</string>
  <string id="13074">We need to think! We can’t discuss this with Weinberg - the project is secret. They’d take us in immediately and send us for experiments.</string>
  <string id="13075">Ask about organs</string>
  <string id="13076">So, transplants will help?</string>
  <string id="13077">Yes, but I can’t reach an agreement with the boss. He says that “evolution knows what's best”! To hell with evolution! Evolution didn’t build the factories that are killing the environment and those workers.</string>
  <string id="13078">Ask about shutting down the factory</string>
  <string id="13079">Would it help if the factory was shut down?</string>
  <string id="13080">Probably. I don't really believe in this option, though. I hope we can come to some kind of agreement with the manager. But the people are so afraid to speak that they won’t even band together to speak up as a group.</string>
  <string id="13081">Suggest a solution to the Suburb problem</string>
  <string id="13082">Official organ deliveries</string>
  <string id="13083">Stephen, I talked to Weinberg about the delivery of unused organs.</string>
  <string id="13084">Do you think that’s the right decision?</string>
  <string id="13085">We have to do something!</string>
  <string id="13086">I think we have to make the most of this chance! Go see him and start making arrangements.</string>
  <string id="13087">I need to think some more</string>
  <string id="13088">Factory closure</string>
  <string id="13089">Stephen, I talked to some people. They said they can arrange a strike that’ll put the factory out of business.</string>
  <string id="13090">I think it's worth a try! Here’s the number: 14-061-789. Call them and set everything up.</string>
  <string id="13091">Well, I'll try!</string>
  <string id="13092">Use the Novichok antidote</string>
  <string id="13093">I thought about it, and I reckon the best thing would be to use the Novichok antidote. You say that it accelerates tissue regeneration - meaning we can cure the sick!</string>
  <string id="13094">Well, I don't know...</string>
  <string id="13095">But I do! I spoke to Oliver Vertinsky. He’ll help you get the amount of antidote you need. Just contact him.</string>
  <string id="13096">Thanks for the help, Evan!</string>
  <string id="13097">-&gt;$9480</string>
  <string id="13098">-&gt;$11495</string>
  <string id="13100">-&gt;$13099</string>
  <string id="13101">That's what people always talk about. Family, weather, work...</string>
  <string id="13102">Listen, I'm here on special terms and I have a double work quota. So I have no time to talk about family, work, weather and other nonsense.</string>
  <string id="13103">-&gt;$13392</string>
  <string id="13104">Stephen, do you think clones are people?</string>
  <string id="13105">Clones are clones. Bags of meat for us to put brains into.</string>
  <string id="13106">But aren't people also bags of meat with brains?</string>
  <string id="13107">You're smart! But if you feel sorry for the clones, you won't last here long.</string>
  <string id="13108">-&gt;$13402</string>
  <string id="13109">Could you tell me about our colleagues?</string>
  <string id="13110">Who do you want to know about?</string>
  <string id="13111">-&gt;$13411</string>
  <string id="13112">Tell me about Maria Curie.</string>
  <string id="13113">What is there to tell? She walks around and babbles. I can't understand a thing she says! They say she was a prominent scientist back in her own country, so our intelligence services stole her. But she has zero value here.</string>
  <string id="13114">-&gt;$6661</string>
  <string id="13115">Like I said, no one can understand what she's mumbling about! And it's impossible to find interpreters in the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="13116">Horatio Newport</string>
  <string id="13117">What about Newport?</string>
  <string id="13118">I’ve never understood these child prodigies! I’ve heard that he has an enormous IQ, but he works like any other idiot!</string>
  <string id="13119">Isaac Weinberg</string>
  <string id="13120">What can you tell me about the boss?</string>
  <string id="13121">What is there to say about him? He’s a brilliant scientist, but like all geniuses, he’s a bit crazy. He adores his clones and tinkers with them constantly in his laboratory. Sometimes I think that they are all he needs.</string>
  <string id="13122">-&gt;$13422</string>
  <string id="13123">I never thought there’d be a whole floor in the Ministry occupied by clones!</string>
  <string id="13124">But that is our future!</string>
  <string id="13125">These clones will soon replace you, me and everyone else working in the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="13126">Doesn't that scare you?</string>
  <string id="13127">I just hope it happens after I’m dead. In the meantime, I just do science, like everyone else here.</string>
  <string id="13128">Ask about the suburbs</string>
  <string id="13129">Stephen, how are your charges doing?</string>
  <string id="13130">Worse than you can imagine! Instead of a holding a strike, those bastards blew up the chemical factory and it closed down.</string>
  <string id="13131">Isn't that good?</string>
  <string id="13132">Depends on how you look at it... Now people in the village aren’t just sick - now they don't have any work, either.</string>
  <string id="13133">They used to have no medicine, and now they have no food. The new tomorrow is better than yesterday, ugh!</string>
  <string id="13134">Stephen…</string>
  <string id="13135">And the explosion formed a cloud that covered half the village. When it cleared... It was a terrible sight!</string>
  <string id="13136">Better than they were! The Ministry opened a hospital in the village that does transplant surgeries for free...</string>
  <string id="13137">That's wonderful!</string>
  <string id="13138">Based on lists.</string>
  <string id="13139">Well, they need to keep records..</string>
  <string id="13140">And on the annual surgery plan…</string>
  <string id="13141">Well, they have to somehow foresee everything...</string>
  <string id="13142">And on your merits for the state.</string>
  <string id="13143">So now people die knowing that the state cares about them.</string>
  <string id="13144">They are less sick. The Ministry arranged deliveries of the Novichok antidote, which neutralizes the factory's poisons in the body.</string>
  <string id="13145">Great news!</string>
  <string id="13146">It’s a good thing I didn't use it!</string>
  <string id="13148">-&gt;$13147</string>
  <string id="13149">Now the residents can’t go beyond the perimeter of the pollution zone. When they do not receive the necessary chemical elements from the outside, the antidote starts taking them from the body and destroys the person in a matter of days.</string>
  <string id="13150">-&gt;$8003</string>
  <string id="13151">This is our country, son. Get used to it!</string>
  <string id="13152">I can help them as long as I’m working here!</string>
  <string id="13153">Is this the chemical factory in the suburbs where there was an accident a few years ago?</string>
  <string id="13154">The very same! After the accident, people in the nearby buildings started dying in terrible agony, but our beloved state chose to fence off the whole village wait for them all to perish.</string>
  <string id="13155">Here, in this place, I can get them medicines, surgical tools and transplants!</string>
  <string id="13156">You steal cloned organs?!</string>
  <string id="13157">“You steal cloned organs?!” Yes, I do! They’d just go right into the Shredder anyway, and I can use them to save people!</string>
  <string id="13158">Do you have a favorite TV show? Something about medicine, I bet?</string>
  <string id="13159">So you assume that just because I have a disability, I must automatically watch something about medicine? I like science fiction. Quantum Junk Heap, for example. I really like it. At least on that show they don’t try to treat hemorrhoids with the Leader's quotations.</string>
  <string id="13160">I tried watching Quantum Junk Heap and didn't understand a thing!</string>
  <string id="13161">Did you watch it from the beginning?</string>
  <string id="13162">There are plenty of strange things in the first episode: a synchrophasatron, beams, radiation, the theory of relativity, all that... And I'm not very good at physics...</string>
  <string id="13163">Well, just ask if there’s anything you want to know! I'm always happy to help. At least I'll have someone to discuss new episodes with!</string>
  <string id="13164">Stephen, Quantum Junk Heap isn’t that boring after all! If you dig a bit deeper, then everything gets clearer - even to a fool like me!</string>
  <string id="13165">What did I tell you? Just wait ‘til it gets its claws into you!</string>
  <string id="13166">But I don't understand: if Kirk Muglas jumped into a time loop, how did he get back on the spaceship again?</string>
  <string id="13167">Yes, I know exactly what you mean! I even wrote a letter to the show’s creators about this mistake! I’m glad you picked up on that!</string>
  <string id="13168">Stephen, did you see the new episode of Quantum Junk Heap? What did you think of the part where...</string>
  <string id="13169">Don’t! No spoilers! I want to see it for myself!</string>

  <string id="13172">-&gt;$13171</string>
  <string id="13173">Suit yourself.</string>

  <string id="13177">Err… but… but how…</string>
  <string id="13178">I can make a third copy of myself at this time.</string>
  <string id="13179">No, thank you… Two is enough.</string>
  <string id="13180">Open the door!</string>
  <string id="13181">Hello, Evan!</string>
  <string id="13182">Sorry, do I know you?</string>
  <string id="13183">You don't know me. Or, more precisely, you know me, but not now. Or actually you do know me now, but you don't know that it's me.</string>
  <string id="13184">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="13185">I am Horatio Newport.</string>
  <string id="13186">Hey, I know a Horatio Newport! Wait, are you his father? What do you want?</string>
  <string id="13187">No, I'm not his father. I am Horatio Newport. But from the future.</string>
  <string id="13188">Hear him out</string>
  <string id="13189">Go on...</string>
  <string id="13190">I don’t have a lot of time, so I’ll cut to the chase.</string>
  <string id="13191">There is an fault in the clones. In their firmware. I made this error when we were working together on the same floor.</string>
  <string id="13192">What kind of fault?</string>
  <string id="13193">It doesn't matter! The important thing is that clones have retained their repressed aggression, and will start killing people in the future because they consider them to be imperfect.</string>
  <string id="13194">And what do you want from me?</string>
  <string id="13195">You must stop me from making this mistake!</string>
  <string id="13196">Send him away</string>
  <string id="13197">Right, I see! You're crazy. Please leave my home before I call the police!</string>
  <string id="13198">Evan, I'm not crazy! I know what will happen to you tomorrow, next year and even further ahead! I know everything about every employee on the 25th floor. But most importantly, I know what mistake I’ll make myself! You must help me! Just listen to me!</string>
  <string id="13199">Send him away</string>
  <string id="13200">Get out immediately!</string>
  <string id="13201">Evan, you’re making a huge mistake!</string>
  <string id="13202">OUT!</string>
  <string id="13203">Prove that you are from the future</string>
  <string id="13204">How can you prove that you’re from the future?</string>
  <string id="13205">I knew that you’d want to make sure.</string>
  <string id="13206">Looks like someone is knocking on the door. Will you open it?</string>
  <string id="13207">Why don't you do it yourself?</string>
  <string id="13208">We invented a time machine, but it only has enough power to get us into the past for 15 minutes. I don’t have time to get to myself and explain everything.</string>
  <string id="13209">But you got to me somehow?</string>
  <string id="13210">The present me lives in a guarded house for young geniuses. There’s no way in.</string>
  <string id="13211">What about work?</string>
  <string id="13212">I won't even talk to myself at work. I was quite an arrogant jerk!</string>
  <string id="13213">What do I need to do?</string>
  <string id="13214">It’s useless to talk to the young me. You have to gain access to my terminal and fix the code.</string>
  <string id="13215">But I don't know how!</string>
  <string id="13216">It's easy, I'll explain everything.</string>
  <string id="13217">And what if I fail?</string>
  <string id="13218">If you don’t help me, I will have only one option - to kill myself here and disappear forever. There’s enough time to take one shot. Although I would prefer not to.</string>
  <string id="13219">And what about the fault?</string>
  <string id="13220">It won’t carry over to the new version of the firmware, and the clones won’t become aggressive. We’re running out of time, Evan!</string>

  <string id="13230">I’m not interested. Get out!</string>
  <string id="13231">I knew you wouldn't refuse!</string>
  <string id="13232">My time is running out, so hurry. You have to access the terminal and select the correct combination.</string>
  <string id="13233">Learn how to gain access</string>
  <string id="13234">Why don't you tell me the password for your terminal?</string>

  <string id="13240">Ask about those who escaped</string>
  <string id="13241">How did you survive?</string>
  <string id="13242">I was working at a top-secret fortified scientific site. We didn't use clones: they were too dumb for the job. So we survived.</string>
  <string id="13244">-&gt;$13243</string>
  <string id="13245">I don’t know. Communications collapsed almost instantly. And then the clones began to attack. One of the anthropologists said it’s because they have no other goals left.</string>
  <string id="13246">We have watchtowers with machine guns, but those creatures grow in number every day.</string>
  <string id="13247">Ask about new technologies</string>
  <string id="13248">Is there no future technology that can fix the fault?</string>
  <string id="13249">There is... But before anyone can use it, they’d need to deal with all those clones who’ve already lost it! And there are too many of them!</string>
  <string id="13250">-&gt;$6661</string>
  <string id="13251">Cloning technology seemed like a great solution to most of our problems. Clones replaced anyone who could be replaced for the sake of improvement. But we came to our senses too late.</string>
  <string id="13252">Ask about the country and the Leader</string>
  <string id="13253">And how did the Great Leader react? Did the authorities do anything?</string>
  <string id="13254">I do not think he was told. Yes, even if he had been - he was already in bad shape after 138 heart transplants, and after 167 he became very weak and barely understood a thing.</string>
  <string id="13255">I don't even know whether he’s alive or not. We didn’t receive any news from the outside after the incident.</string>
  <string id="13256">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="13257">Sorry, I have to go! Time is running out! I hope that I’ll be returning to a different world from the one I left.</string>

  <string id="13259">B?</string>
  <string id="13260">Gotta go!</string>
  <string id="13261">Evan, you are an unbelievable fool! I said that the correct option was “b”!</string>
  <string id="13262">Horatio? What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="13263">When I got back, nothing had changed! You didn’t alter the firmware, Evan!</string>
  <string id="13264">Well... I tried!</string>
  <string id="13265">That’s not enough! Maybe now you can at least help defeat the fever!</string>
  <string id="13266">I made a mistake, Evan!</string>
  <string id="13267">Hello, Horatio. You said that line already.</string>
  <string id="13268">No, you don’t understand!</string>
  <string id="13269">Right after the firmware installation, the Boss and I vaccinated the Carls against all disease and they developed an incredible immunity to everything.</string>
  <string id="13270">Where are you going with that?</string>
  <string id="13271">Including the Borean fever, damn it. But the vaccine turned out to be defective, and instead of getting a perfectly protected Carl, we genetically modified it with a biological bomb in 23 generations - in our time they suddenly became carriers of Borean fever.</string>
  <string id="13272">But it's been defeated for 300 years at least!</string>
  <string id="13273">A group of bona fide moron clones excavated an old burial ground. With their perfect immunity, they never even noticed that they caught it, and went on to spread it to people.</string>
  <string id="13274">What happened next?</string>
  <string id="13275">Since everyone had forgotten about the disease, there was no medicine to treat it. Only patients in the infection wards and our group of scientists were saved.</string>
  <string id="13276">How did you manage?</string>
  <string id="13277">When the authorities learned about the epidemic, all the geniuses were relocated to an underground bunker, where there were no clones and no connections to the outside world. As you know, I was among them.</string>
  <string id="13278">You're something else, Horatio!</string>
  <string id="13279">I'm a genius! Otherwise I wouldn’t be here.</string>
  <string id="13280">How can I help?</string>
  <string id="13281">You’re unlikely to find a vaccine for Borean fever. Even in this time, it's a long-forgotten scary story.</string>
  <string id="13282">Here, this is a revised vaccine, the composition of which is completely identical to the one that we injected into the clones. If you inject all the Carls with it, you’ll stop the epidemic before it even starts.</string>
  <string id="13283">That’s going to be difficult.</string>
  <string id="13284">It’s going to be even more difficult for all those people in the future who die from bursting eyes and boiling blood.</string>
  <string id="13286">-&gt;$13285</string>
  <string id="13287">I have to go. Figure it out.</string>
  <string id="13288">Help for prepayment</string>
  <string id="13289">New business - new prepayments!</string>
  <string id="13290">Keep your paper. It’s useless in my time, anyhow.</string>
  <string id="13291">I'm not interested</string>
  <string id="13292">Horatio, or whatever your name is. I already got involved in your crazy project once, and now you’ve come to tell me that in some future, someone died from a disease that only encyclopedias know about?</string>
  <string id="13293">But it's true! You know that I’m a scientist - I can’t lie!</string>
  <string id="13294">Ask about documentation</string>
  <string id="13295">To begin with, I don’t know who you really are. Do you have any documentation?</string>
  <string id="13296">What kind? I have a chip in my head - do you have a mu-frequency scanner? You can check!</string>
  <string id="13297">Ask about fingerprints</string>
  <string id="13298">What about fingerprints?</string>
  <string id="13299">What about them? Look here, I have a scar on my finger!</string>
  <string id="13300">That's way too fresh.</string>
  <string id="13301">I have more important things to do than study the operational principles of can openers! We still use cans on our base, and those military blockheads don’t bother doing anything!</string>
  <string id="13302">Ask about the vaccine</string>
  <string id="13303">How do I know what’s in this tube?</string>
  <string id="13304">You don't.</string>
  <string id="13305">Evan, I know that I can’t prove anything to you, because every time I come it changes the future. All the people I’ve known all my life aren’t the same as before. Some have died. Some I’ve killed with my own hands.</string>
  <string id="13306">-&gt;$9388</string>
  <string id="13307">Evan, when the Borean Fever takes over, it is better to shoot someone so that they does not suffer. That is a scientific fact. Yes, they themselves are asking for it.</string>
  <string id="13308">-&gt;$11305</string>
  <string id="13309">I don’t believe you!</string>
  <string id="13310">Scientists always lie when they believe it can be of benefit to science.</string>
  <string id="13311">But it’s true! What could be more important than science?</string>
  <string id="13312">You, the you who’s here, once told me that people are just petri dishes to you.</string>
  <string id="13313">It’s not like that, Evan! You don't have to do anything - I can do everything on my own and kill myself! I'm ready! I’ll sacrifice myself for the future!</string>
  <string id="13314">Well, that's nice! I pass.</string>
  <string id="13315">-&gt;$11299</string>
  <string id="13316">Fine, I’ll help you!</string>
  <string id="13317">Fine, I’ll help you! But for a small prepayment!</string>
  <string id="13318">Evan, you utter loser!</string>
  <string id="13319">Horatio? I wasn’t expecting to see you again...</string>
  <string id="13320">You told the boss everything! You ruined everything!</string>
  <string id="13321">-&gt;$11345</string>
  <string id="13322">Sorry, Horatio! I may look gullible, but not enough to believe in stories about the future.</string>
  <string id="13323">You and I could get rich. If you had done everything like I asked, you’d have a big pile of money on your desk right now!</string>
  <string id="13324">But you betrayed me... All traitors have one price - this is your reward!</string>
  <string id="13325">Horatio...</string>
  <string id="13326">It would've been better if the future died then... Goodbye, Evan!</string>
  <string id="13327">Kick out</string>
  <string id="13328">Horatio, I'm tired of these stories.</string>
  <string id="13329">This isn’t the first time you’ve come to me uninvited. “Evan save the future”, “Evan this”, “Evan that”... Enough of this nonsense! I’ve had enough of it! Get out!</string>
  <string id="13330">Ah well? Then get it!</string>
  <string id="13331">Evan, it worked!</string>
  <string id="13332">Horatio? I didn’t expect to see you again! Didn’t you say that you had a limited number of jumps?</string>
  <string id="13333">I have no limits now, Evan. But let's cut to the chase.</string>
  <string id="13334">We recently opened up an archive, and there was a lot of money from your time inside. We could use it for experiments, but I thought it would be a worthy reward for someone like you.</string>
  <string id="13335">Like me?</string>
  <string id="13336">Well yes. You were just following my orders.</string>
  <string id="13337">Tell him to shove it</string>
  <string id="13338">And you just came to me, sprinkling ashes on your head and asking for help! Go to hell with your money!</string>
  <string id="13339">I knew we should've just used it for experiments…</string>
  <string id="13340">And actually, I have to go. You're doing fine. Good job.</string>
  <string id="13341">You...</string>
  <string id="13342">Good luck, Evan! Take care of yourself!</string>
  <string id="13344">-&gt;$13343</string>
  <string id="13345">Give me that money! I wasn’t expecting it, but I’m not going to turn it down!</string>
  <string id="13346">That's the right attitude! How often do you have the honor of receiving money from the hands of the brightest mind of your distant future?</string>
  <string id="13347">Well, actually, it's just money.</string>
  <string id="13348">Well, actually, I didn’t expect that you would appreciate the moment. You never came across as the smart type.</string>
  <string id="13349">-&gt;$13060</string>
  <string id="13350">Let's get down to business!</string>
  <string id="13351">Alright. Here. I don’t know whether we’ll meet again or not. Most likely not - I do not want to come back here. But if you happen see me walking down the street - don’t come up to say hi, okay?</string>
  <string id="13352">I just don't want to. Bye!</string>
  <string id="13353">It's all your fault, Evan Redgrave! My blood is on your hands!</string>
  <string id="13354">Anyone who doesn’t believe in a future life is already dead in this one, Evan.</string>
  <string id="13355">Hello! I'm Evan, I’ve just started working on this floor.</string>
  <string id="13356">So. Are you a scientist or an attendant?</string>
  <string id="13357">Attendant?</string>
  <string id="13358">I see. Attendant it is. Since you’ll be working with me, I’m ready to spend some of my precious time explaining to you just what I expect.</string>
  <string id="13359">Wait...</string>
  <string id="13360">I'll start with the main thing. My name is Dr. Horatio Newport. I am 20 years old. I am the head genius here. After Weinberg, I'm the main administrator here. In terms of scientific issues, I'm simply in charge.</string>
  <string id="13361">I understand. You’re in charge.</string>
  <string id="13362">Correct. You are a servant, and I am in charge.</string>
  <string id="13363">OK...</string>
  <string id="13364">-&gt;$6638</string>
  <string id="13365">-&gt;$7234</string>
  <string id="13366">Please do not disturb me!</string>
  <string id="13367">I'm on the verge of a discovery...</string>
  <string id="13368">I hope it's work-related?</string>
  <string id="13369">I'm busy!</string>
  <string id="13371">-&gt;$13370</string>
  <string id="13372">Talk about the qualities of Carl Stein</string>
  <string id="13373">Talk about clone vaccination</string>
  <string id="13374">Talk about Novichok</string>
  <string id="13375">Horatio, have you heard anything about the Novichok antidote?</string>
  <string id="13376">The universal antidote for everything that causes tissue to regenerate with incredible speed? Of course I’ve heard of it! It’s utter quackery!</string>
  <string id="13377">-&gt;$6661</string>
  <string id="13378">Panaceas do not exist, much the same as perpetual motion. And if you were a scientist, you would know that.</string>
  <string id="13380">-&gt;$13379</string>
  <string id="13381">-&gt;$6747</string>
  <string id="13382">-&gt;$6265</string>
  <string id="13383">Tell me about the tests. I don't want to upset the boss...</string>
  <string id="13384">If you are a human, you’ll have a hard time pleasing him. Only perfect Carls can do that.</string>
  <string id="13385">Tell me about Carl Zero’s personality. The boss instructed me to collect data for the experiment.</string>
  <string id="13386">Did he take you as an assistant?!</string>
  <string id="13387">No, of course not, he just asked me to collect data about the properties of the person transmitted from the human Carl to the clone.</string>
  <string id="13388">Ah.. That's nothing!.. So! The main thing that was transmitted to Carl Zero from the original was a stable nervous system. Thanks to that, the clones can withstand the uploading of consciousness without going crazy afterwards.</string>
  <string id="13389">You’ve been tasked with getting it, so go get it. Who do you think you are, that I’d waste my time on you?</string>
  <string id="13390">-&gt;$9004</string>
  <string id="13391">Discuss the Schrödinger Effect</string>
  <string id="13393">-&gt;$13392</string>
  <string id="13394">Why are all clones the same?</string>
  <string id="13395">Because we scientists don't care what the petri dish looks like. What matters is what's going on in it.</string>
  <string id="13396">Weinberg made the wise decision to optimize the cost of appearance, which allows me to focus my attention on improving the content.</string>
  <string id="13397">What does that mean?</string>
  <string id="13398">Weinberg and I are developing a new version of the Carls. They will be perfect! Obedient living robots! Perfect servants!</string>
  <string id="13399">They will conquer the whole world!</string>
  <string id="13400">We have developed special brain firmware and vaccines for genetic mutations. The results of the latest vaccination are staggering! If our theories are confirmed... It will be an incredible breakthrough!</string>
  <string id="13401">That information is classified. You wouldn’t understand - these are matters of science.</string>
  <string id="13403">-&gt;$13402</string>
  <string id="13404">Can you tell me anything about our colleagues?</string>
  <string id="13405">I have one colleague - Weinberg. All the rest are... ech... junior scientific staff and attendants.</string>
  <string id="13406">Stephen Dawking</string>
  <string id="13407">I have two higher degrees, and PhDs in biology, medicine and anatomy. But I still don’t understand how a disabled person could be hired to create the perfect human.</string>
  <string id="13408">His mind still works though, right?</string>
  <string id="13409">What can he bring to perfection? Frustration over his own ugliness? I do not understand!</string>
  <string id="13410">I knew that bringing a disabled person to the floor where perfect people are created was a bad idea. Well, at least that got figured out!</string>
  <string id="13412">-&gt;$13411</string>
  <string id="13413">I don’t understand why they keep her here. The language of science is universal, of course, but she’s a woman!</string>
  <string id="13414">And what's wrong with that?</string>
  <string id="13415">Even if anyone here could understand her, I doubt that she’d be capable of contributing anything to scientific thought.</string>
  <string id="13416">Why was she arrested, again? Ah, doesn't matter... If she couldn't even think a crime through, what is there to say about her scientific work? It’s no doubt as useless as her plan...</string>
  <string id="13417">The boss</string>
  <string id="13418">He is the only person I could call my equal when it comes to intellectual capacity, knowledge, and scientific standing. True, in recent times he has become fascinated by some Gnostic theories, but great minds aren’t without their eccentricities.</string>
  <string id="13419">No matter what anyone says, I believe that isolating Weinberg from scientific activity is a real crime! His was one of the greatest minds of our time, he shouldn't be distracted!</string>
  <string id="13420">On the other hand, I think I know who the new boss will be.</string>
  <string id="13421">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="13423">-&gt;$13422</string>
  <string id="13424">Why did you think I'm an attendant?</string>
  <string id="13425">On this floor, people are divided into scientists and attendants. Scientists create, and attendants simply replicate their discoveries and help to make new ones. I don’t think it’s necessary explain who is more important. Or is there?</string>
  <string id="13426">Ask about family</string>
  <string id="13427">Your family must be proud of you. Dr. Newport.</string>
  <string id="13428">They would be proud - if they weren’t so self-important! My father was only ever awarded the minor Leader’s Medal for Science, whereas I, don't you know, have been awarded the major medal, the state prize and last year’s Best Scientist Cup!</string>
  <string id="13429">When I pointed out to him that he was objectively less intelligent than me, he stopped talking to me. So now I live in a closed dorm for geniuses.</string>
  <string id="13430">Do you watch TV?</string>
  <string id="13431">Great minds need a break, too. But no vulgarity like romance or shooting - not interested. I watch The Schrödinger Effect. It's about this scientist who can split himself in two for double efficiency!</string>
  <string id="13432">Dr. Newport, can you help me? I took your advice and started watching The Schrödinger Effect, but I couldn’t figure out whether the main character is alive or dead.</string>
  <string id="13433">It is commendable that you enjoy quality entertainment. But if you think that I’ll talk TV with you, you're mistaken.</string>
  <string id="13434">I'm sorry, Dr. Newport, I know that you don’t like to discuss TV shows... But The Schrödinger Effect is incredible! Thanks for telling me about it!</string>
  <string id="13435">Please... uh... What's your name?</string>
  <string id="13437">-&gt;$13436</string>
  <string id="13438">You’re welcome, Evan! I'm glad that even mediocrities like yourself are drawn to real art.</string>
  <string id="13439">Dr. Newport! The latest episode of the Schrödinger Effect is something else! That bit with the cat just blew my mind!</string>
  <string id="13440">Probability theory had the same effect on me when I was five years old. But I’m glad that you are becoming smarter under my influence.</string>
  <string id="13441">Dr. Newport! I want to discuss the vaccination of the clones with you.</string>
  <string id="13442">There is nothing to discuss here. That information is classified. And besides, do not distract me - I have a lot to do!</string>
  <string id="13443">That's what I wanted to talk about! Let me help you with the vaccinations! A great mind such as yours shouldn’t be wasted on giving injections to clones. And I might learn a thing or two!</string>
  <string id="13444">Well... I suppose you do have a point... It’s like hammering nails with a microscope. And it would be beneficial to you, that's true. Can you do it, though?</string>
  <string id="13445">My mother was sick for a long time... I had to give her injections. I think I’ll manage OK.</string>
  <string id="13446">Fine… Proceed. In the meantime, I need to contemplate a thought that may lead to another scientific breakthrough!</string>
  <string id="15125">What makes you think that I’d want to discuss my research with an underling?</string>
  <string id="13447">Hello! I'm Evan Redgrave. I was recently promoted and transferred to this floor.</string>
  <string id="13448">Due to your merits or your Authority?</string>
  <string id="13449">Due to merit</string>
  <string id="13450">That's good. All creatures should be judged by their actions, not subjective impressions. Do you agree?</string>
  <string id="13451">I guess...</string>
  <string id="13452">Now, that is wrong. A person need never doubt themselves as long as they are doing the right thing. Yes?</string>
  <string id="13453">Yes!</string>
  <string id="13454">You learn fast. Well, let's get acquainted! I’m Isaac Weinberg. I was a good friend of your father and I’m the head of this floor.</string>
  <string id="13455">Due to Authority</string>
  <string id="13456">That won’t get you anywhere on my floor. Here we only value true achievements in the field of science.</string>
  <string id="13457">I'll remember that!</string>
  <string id="13458">You'd better. I’m Isaac Weinberg. I am the demiurge of this floor and all that transpires on it.</string>
  <string id="13459">Demiurge? Does that mean... creator?</string>
  <string id="13460">Yes. Your father came up with that one. I create new creatures and breathe life into them. He and I were pretty close. Until... the accident.</string>
  <string id="13461">Good to see you, Evan.</string>
  <string id="13462">I hope there’s a very important reason why you’re distracting me?</string>
  <string id="13463">... and what if we give Carl more aggression? Hmm... No... That’s not an option... How may I help you, Evan?</string>
  <string id="13464">Redgrave? Your father was constantly bothering me with trivial matters too. Speak.</string>
  <string id="13465">Find out what he wants</string>
  <string id="13466">Give him the emitters and report on performance</string>
  <string id="13467">Report test results</string>
  <string id="13468">Report on Carl Stein</string>
  <string id="13469">Talk about the Canon of Clones</string>
  <string id="13470">Tell about the time traveler</string>
  <string id="13471">Call for help in the Suburbs</string>
  <string id="13472">-&gt;$6747</string>
  <string id="13473">-&gt;$6265</string>
  <string id="13474">Evan, I have an important task for you. Can you be trusted?</string>
  <string id="13475">I'll do what I can, Comrade Weinberg.</string>
  <string id="13476">As you know, on this floor we bend nature to our will and reshape human nature as we please. You’ve probably wondered why.</string>
  <string id="13477">-&gt;$9203</string>
  <string id="13478">Why, to correct mistakes! Over the course of our evolution, humans have accumulated so much genetic, biological and social debris that we simply cannot keep encouraging the haphazard and chaotic development of our species!</string>
  <string id="13479">But I thought we couldn’t do anything about that?</string>
  <string id="13480">Wrong! And that is exactly what your task is concerned with. We have learned to remotely stimulate certain parts of the brain, causing recipients to react in accordance with our wishes.</string>
  <string id="13481">Department RGD-9, acting under orders from the Ministry of Patriotism, has developed portable emitters. You need to install them in the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="13482">Ask about emitters</string>
  <string id="13483">What are these emitters?</string>
  <string id="13484">A side development from our main project with your father. They work at the physiological level: they stimulate the patriotism gland and the production of adrenaline.</string>
  <string id="13485">Patriotism gland?</string>
  <string id="13486">Yes, such a thing exists. I’ll show you later. The Ministry has decided to give its employees some extra love for the motherland, as well a productivity boost.</string>
  <string id="13487">Is that possible?</string>
  <string id="13488">I told you, Evan: we're at the point where we can correct nature's mistakes. And there are quite a lot of those in humans!</string>
  <string id="13489">And yes, I can do anything here.</string>
  <string id="13490">Ask about safety</string>
  <string id="13491">Is it safe?</string>
  <string id="13492">It's actually good for people, Evan! They’ve all gotten lazy and forgotten who makes their lives happier.</string>
  <string id="13493">Ask about installation spots</string>
  <string id="13494">And where should I put the emitters?</string>
  <string id="13495">The processing procedure requires that the recipient remains within the emission radius for a certain time.</string>
  <string id="13496">Therefore, the patriotism emitters must be placed inside statues and busts of the Leader. We'll have just enough time for the procedure while people are cheering.</string>
  <string id="13497">-&gt;$9460</string>
  <string id="13498">The productivity amplifiers should be put in crowded places. Vending machines, eateries, water fountains, office phones.</string>
  <string id="13499">We don't need any on our floor. Everyone is working hard here already.</string>
  <string id="13500">I see.</string>
  <string id="13501">-&gt;$7502</string>
  <string id="13502">Got it. Shall I get started?</string>
  <string id="13503">Here are the emitters. You'll figure out which is which as you go along. There are some extra - just hand them in when you're done.</string>
  <string id="13504">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="13505">I don't want to irradiate people without their consent!</string>
  <string id="13506">Children are sent to school without their consent, too - they won't get smart otherwise!</string>
  <string id="13507">But we’re not talking about children! These are my colleagues!</string>
  <string id="13508">We are all someone's colleagues. Besides, we’ll only get a little bit of patriotism, while the other floors could do with a productivity boost.</string>
  <string id="13509">Your father and I came up with this technology together. I didn’t think you would mind. He considered it to be very promising.</string>
  <string id="13510">-&gt;$9603</string>
  <string id="13511">If my father thought that it was for the best... then I agree.</string>
  <string id="13512">I knew you would, although I wish I didn't have to waste so much time. Don’t do that again.</string>
  <string id="13513">Insist on your refusal</string>
  <string id="13514">I don't believe that my father would have stood for this. Secretly controlling another person is low!</string>
  <string id="13515">So it’s better to do it out in the open?</string>
  <string id="13516">Everyone should have the right to decide what they do and what they believe!</string>
  <string id="13517">So you think that we’re causing harm to humanity here?</string>
  <string id="13518">It seems to me that you’re crazy here - you’re trying to force people to stop being themselves.</string>
  <string id="13519">That’s what all forms of power do. And no forms of power tolerate those who stand in their way.</string>
  <string id="13520">So what, are you going to irradiate me, too?</string>
  <string id="13521">Why waste the energy? The perfect world can manage without you.</string>
  <string id="13522">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="13523">I’m done with the emitters, Comrade Weinberg.</string>
  <string id="13524">Did everything go as planned?</string>
  <string id="13525">Yes, I did everything just like you said: statues and vending machines!</string>
  <string id="13526">Were there enough emitters?</string>
  <string id="13527">Yes, there were even some left over.</string>
  <string id="13528">I asked you to bring those back.</string>
  <string id="13529">Sorry, I must have gotten too caught up in the work...</string>
  <string id="13530">This is what I’m talking about, Evan, when I talk about the shortcomings of humanity. Bad memory, low responsibility, excuses. We'll fix it all. But for now, bring me the emitters.</string>
  <string id="13531">Excellent. Let's see how this will affect the overall indicators of personality testing...</string>
  <string id="13532">Where did we leave off? Hmmm....</string>
  <string id="13533">You said that the emitters are a side project of your work with my father. And what was the main goal?</string>
  <string id="13534">Unfortunately, I can't tell you that, Evan. It’s classified.</string>
  <string id="13535">Heimdall?</string>
  <string id="13536">Yes... What?! No! I never mentioned anything about that!</string>
  <string id="13537">In a nutshell, at least? This has got to be some brilliant idea!</string>
  <string id="13538">“Brilliant” doesn’t even begin to describe it. Well, fine... In a nutshell? The world is not perfect.</string>
  <string id="13539">Sorry, Comrade Weinberg, but that's not such a... uhm... new idea.</string>
  <string id="13540">The novelty of an idea is determined by the conclusions derived from it, Evan. Caleb and I came to the conclusion that imperfection can be corrected if we correct those who create it. That is to say, people.</string>
  <string id="13541">Either they stop making mistakes... Or they will have to be replaced by those who do not make mistakes.</string>
  <string id="13542">Replaced?! By whom?</string>
  <string id="13543">Look around you. Do you still not understand?</string>
  <string id="13544">Clones? Do you want to replace people with clones?</string>
  <string id="13545">For starters, we just need to get to know people better. Dissect their consciousness. Understand their essence, so as not to repeat their mistakes in clones.</string>
  <string id="13546">Have you already undergone personality testing?</string>
  <string id="13547">Learn more about testing</string>
  <string id="13548">What for?</string>
  <string id="13549">In my work, I need to constantly check the generalized level of the various personality characteristics of standard people. Testing allows me to assess the degree to which our ideas and efforts affect the mass consciousness.</string>
  <string id="13550">Refuse</string>
  <string id="13551">-&gt;$7690</string>
  <string id="13552">It’s a mandatory procedure. Find a work phone to answer the test questions. And then we’ll compare your results to everyone else’s.</string>
  <string id="13553">Find out whether you're fit to work here.</string>
  <string id="13554">If this is necessary for work, then, of course I’ll do it!</string>
  <string id="13555">Agree</string>
  <string id="13556">Yes? And what was your score?</string>
  <string id="13557">The ability to lie is the first thing that we exclude from the character of clones. Laziness is the second. And third, we reduce the pain threshold, because those who lie and laze around are punished often.</string>
  <string id="13558">Apologies, Comrade Weinberg! This won't happen again. I’ll take the test!</string>
  <string id="13559">I passed the test, Comrade Weinberg!</string>
  <string id="13560">Yes, I saw it. An excellent performance, Evan. I honestly didn’t expect you to be such a great fit!</string>
  <string id="13561">Fit for what?</string>
  <string id="13562">Come. I'll show you something special.</string>
  <string id="13563">Yes, I know. And I don’t think you tried at all.</string>
  <string id="13564">To tell you the truth, I didn’t understand why I was being asked those things.</string>
  <string id="13565">You didn't? Okay, I'll show you something. Follow me.</string>
  <string id="13566">Meet Carl Stein! The so-called “Carl Zero”. The first model. The master copy.</string>
  <string id="13567">Somehow he doesn’t strike me as the perfect specimen...</string>
  <string id="13568">And that's what we, the geneticists and biologists, are here for. When we copy him, we introduce a genetic correction code into the body and “firmware” into his consciousness. The latter suppresses Carl Zero’s unneeded memories and emotions, while enhancing the qualities we're looking for: diligence, submission, endurance, as well as a lack of curiosity, compassion and experience.</string>
  <string id="13569">So, the base version isn’t important to you at all? Why do you keep Carl here then?</string>
  <string id="13570">Historically, all our technologies were designed around him. And recently, a bug has appeared in the firmware that we are still unable to fix.</string>
  <string id="13571">A bug in the firmware?</string>
  <string id="13572">Yes. Carl had a pretty... difficult life. All those fears, experiences and losses got lodged somewhere very deep inside him, and have been manifesting themselves in his clones at the most unexpected times via a weakness in their firmware.</string>
  <string id="13573">And what do you want to do?</string>
  <string id="13574">I have a hypothesis that the breakdown creates a complex memory of the last year of Carl’s life. Something happened during this period. Something very bad. Something that won't stop bugging him, despite the fact that we’ve cut his brain up in every conceivable way.</string>
  <string id="13575">And how do we fix it?</string>
  <string id="13576">We need to find out what those events were, and what combination of memories causes this effect.</string>
  <string id="13577">Don't you know?</string>
  <string id="13578">When I cut up a lab rat, I don't care how many brothers it had or how well it slept. Clones must obey their coding. That's what I know.</string>
  <string id="13579">But he’s not a lab rat!</string>
  <string id="13580">Evan, I have no time to play philosophical games with you. Find out what happened to Carl, and find out how these memories manage to penetrate the firmware.</string>
  <string id="13581">So, find out what hurt him, then hurt him more?</string>
  <string id="13582">Well, when you put it that way... Yes. This is what we call a “scientific experiment”, in case you weren’t aware.</string>
  <string id="13583">I won’t do it. I refuse to torture a living... well, almost living, person, and do him more harm.</string>
  <string id="13584">This is not a man, Evan. This is a clone.</string>
  <string id="13585">Carl Stein died long ago. This thing was grown in a test tube. It might look like Stein, but until we upload the firmware, he can't even breathe on his own. And now there’s a bug in that firmware! What if that affects the lives of all of the clones? Do you want them to suffer?</string>
  <string id="13586">Well… In that case... Okay.</string>
  <string id="13587">As if they aren’t suffering already! No, I don’t want to do this.</string>
  <string id="13588">Evan, I’ve shown you classified research... Revealed the secrets of the universe to you!</string>
  <string id="13589">You think too highly of yourself, Comrade Weinberg. And frankly, you're a lousy demiurge.</string>
  <string id="13590">What?! You child! Security!</string>
  <string id="13591">To get started, collect all the information you can about the last year of Carl Stein’s life - everything you can find. Your colleagues know something - from time to time they’ve needed this kind of information for their work. And there’s bound do be something in the archives.</string>
  <string id="13592">Is the building where he lived still there?</string>
  <string id="13593">Aha! Great idea! You can check the building - there might still be some emotional ties there.</string>
  <string id="13594">And then?</string>
  <string id="13595">And then we’ll create a visual simulation of Carl’s consciousness and feed him everything we’ve found. If my hypothesis is correct, then we’ll find out what’s caused the firmware malfunction.</string>
  <string id="13596">And if not?</string>
  <string id="13597">Then we’ll keep searching, combining, and trying. It should work at some point!</string>
  <string id="13598">Comrade Weinberg, I have gathered all available information about the life of Carl Stein.</string>
  <string id="13599">-&gt;$14384</string>
  <string id="13600">-&gt;$9755</string>
  <string id="13601">Yes. I’ve learned of everything that happened to him. It should help to evoke some strong emotions.</string>
  <string id="13602">Excellent! Come on.</string>
  <string id="13603">Check again</string>
  <string id="13604">I’ll double-check just in case!</string>
  <string id="13605">I have developed a special interface for data exchange with Carl Zero.</string>
  <string id="13606">Now I will create a visual simulation to make it easier for you to control the process. With this interface, you’ll be able to start a dialogue with Carl's consciousness. Your task is to cause a peak reaction - make him experience a barrage of negative emotions.</string>
  <string id="13607">Maybe it’d be better if you did it? I don’t really like torturing people...</string>
  <string id="13608">And have you try to control the visual simulation? No way. You started this, you finish it!</string>
  <string id="13609">But what if I fail?</string>
  <string id="13610">Evan, science can do anything! It's just a matter of how many experiments you carry out - and you have no limits in this regard.</string>
  <string id="13616">Finally! I did it! I found a vulnerability!</string>
  <string id="13617">You?</string>
  <string id="13618">Are you challenging my scientific seniority?</string>
  <string id="13619">No, but...</string>
  <string id="13620">That's right. But I will make note of your efforts in the Canon of Clones.</string>
  <string id="13621">“Canon of Clones”? What is that?</string>
  <string id="13622">Oh yes... I haven’t told you yet... The Canon of Clones is the book that the clones will live by when there is no longer a single person born on Earth naturally.</string>
  <string id="13623">But why would they need a book? You’ve put everything they need in their heads.</string>
  <string id="13624">Even clones need to know how it all began. Here it is. Take a look. Then we can discuss it.</string>
  <string id="13625">Evan? I'm glad to see you. Well, have you read the Canon of Clones?</string>
  <string id="13626">Yes, I have. It reminds me of something... a fatherly creator, obedient prophets, mistakes and sins... Just like some kind of religion.</string>
  <string id="13627">Now you’re getting it!</string>
  <string id="13628">But why do clones need a religion?</string>
  <string id="13629">I’ve been studying the clones for a very long time, and I’ve long understood that even those soulless husks need something to believe in. I can put anything I want in them, so why not a new faith? The right faith?</string>
  <string id="13630">The right faith?</string>
  <string id="13631">Well yes! The infallible creator-scientist leaves his commandments as code with no ability to override them.</string>
  <string id="13632">And are you the infallible scientist?</string>
  <string id="13633">Do you know of any other candidates?</string>
  <string id="13634">Of course not.</string>
  <string id="13635">But creators always have their prophets to transmit their knowledge and help strengthen the faith. You did me a great service in helping me with that vulnerability. Would you like me to include you in the Canon?</string>
  <string id="13636">Why?</string>
  <string id="13637">What do I get from this “Canon”?</string>
  <string id="13638">Think, Evan! The Clone Age is not far off. There will be fewer and fewer people every day. In your opinion, which is a better way to immortalize yourself - being a tool in the Ministry, or being a perfectly-preserved clone memory?</string>
  <string id="13639">And what does that require from me?</string>
  <string id="13640">When the clones have liberated the world from people entirely, we will be the last remaining connection they have with the past. And then you and I will put an end to sin and imperfection on this planet...</string>
  <string id="13641">You and I? Put an end to... You mean...</string>
  <string id="13642">Yes. We will leave this life, and leave behind us magnificent statues to be worshipped by every living being on Earth!</string>
  <string id="13643">Pretty cool, right? Do you like my statues? Yours will be the same, only smaller.</string>
  <string id="13644">Why not? I shall become Evan the Great, or something like that....</string>
  <string id="13645">Hold on! You will be Evan Redgrave, assistant to Isaac the Creator, the great ruler of the Chosen... Nothing more. But that is an honor, too.</string>
  <string id="13647">-&gt;$13646</string>
  <string id="13648">When I need you, I'll let you know. That is all.</string>
  <string id="13649">Gently refuse</string>
  <string id="13650">You know, Comrade Weinberg, it seems to me that I’m not cut out for that role. Me, a prophet?</string>
  <string id="13651">Don't you like my idea?</string>
  <string id="13652">I do, a lot! You’ll make a great god!</string>
  <string id="13653">Well, at least you recognize that. What a pity, Evan, what a pity indeed! I thought we were like-minded...</string>
  <string id="13654">Insult his religious sensibilities</string>
  <string id="13655">I don’t want to be in any “Canon”! This is nonsense! I barely managed to get through ten pages - it’s complete gibberish!</string>
  <string id="13656">Gibberish? It contains within it nothing less than the entire ethical and scientific paradigm of humanity!</string>
  <string id="13657">It is utter insanity! And you're as much a god as a tram is a ballerina.</string>
  <string id="13658">What?! There is no greater god than I! Do you have any idea what I could do to you?</string>
  <string id="13659">Strike me down with lightning? Or no... Send some old guy with a hood and scythe after me? Is that it?</string>
  <string id="13660">Right! Except instead of “some old guy”, it’ll be the Security Service. There is no place on this floor those who would question me. So commands the will of God!</string>
  <string id="13661">Isaac, may I ask you as a scientist: do you believe in time travel?</string>
  <string id="13662">Theoretically, based on what we know, one can travel into the future if traveling at the speed of light, or faster. It isn’t possible to go back into the past.</string>
  <string id="13664">-&gt;$13663</string>
  <string id="13665">What’s bothering you, Evan? Have you invented a time machine?</string>
  <string id="13666">I haven’t. But recently, a man came to my home, introduced himself as Horatio Newport and said that he had come from the future.</string>
  <string id="13667">Horatio Newport? Our Horatio? Fascinating! And what did he want?</string>
  <string id="13668">He wanted me to meddle with the cloning technology because, in his words, there are some faults in it, and those faults will cause the clones to attack people in the future.</string>
  <string id="13669">Poppycock! That’s not possible.</string>
  <string id="13670">Which part - the part about the faults?</string>
  <string id="13671">Especially the part about the faults! The technology is almost perfect! But I'm talking about time travel - it’s pure idiocy!</string>
  <string id="13672">Yes? Um... And what if I believed him?</string>
  <string id="13673">What do you mean you believed him, Evan? Did you do anything to the technology?</string>
  <string id="13674">Well, yes... I made some changes to the firmware and changed the vaccine... Because yours was defective.</string>
  <string id="13675">WHAT?! Evan, do you have any idea what you've done?! Do you know what will happen to you now?!</string>
  <string id="13676">Pay off</string>
  <string id="13677">Guilty! It won’t happen again! I’m ready to atone!</string>
  <string id="13678">Well, well... At ease, soldier. This is a temple of science, not a barracks. It’s good that you owned up to this, and it’s not too late to fix it.</string>
  <string id="13679">But we’ll have to transfer Newport to a better place. Better, farther away, and quieter...</string>
  <string id="13680">Who do you think you are?! Three doctors of science, five professors and one academician worked on that firmware! That vaccine took five years of work! Do you think you know our work better than we do?</string>
  <string id="13681">You’ve destroyed your career with your own hands, Evan. Sorry, but I can't help you now.</string>
  <string id="13682">Make peace</string>
  <string id="13683">If I hadn’t done this, everyone would have died after 23 generations of clones! I’ve done my duty to the future!</string>
  <string id="13684">Evan, you are breathtakingly idiotic! I literally cannot spare the breath required to swear at you right now.</string>
  <string id="13685">Guard, take this idiot away!</string>
  <string id="13686">Find out what's in store</string>
  <string id="13687">What should I expect?</string>
  <string id="13688">Oh, you’re better off not knowing!</string>
  <string id="13689">Leave in silence</string>
  <string id="13690">Well... He was so persuasive! I...</string>
  <string id="13691">What are you saying, Evan? Did you really believe that charlatan?!</string>
  <string id="13692">Well... I made some corrections to the firmware...</string>
  <string id="13693">Well, well... At ease, soldier. This is a temple of science, not a barracks. We’ll take a look at your firmware. Maybe the damage isn’t too bad.</string>
  <string id="13694">But we’ll transfer Newport to a better place. Better, farther away, and quieter.</string>
  <string id="13695">Who do you think you are?! Three doctors of science, five professors and one academician worked on this firmware! Do you think you know our work better than we do?</string>
  <string id="13696">He was most likely yet another South Borean spy. They’ve been after our technology for a long time.</string>
  <string id="13697">He seemed suspicious to me, too.</string>
  <string id="13698">You’ve done well by reporting this! So, they’re interested in Newport... I’ll transfer him to the secret block, just in case.</string>
  <string id="13699">Redgrave! What are you doing, you scoundrel! How did it even occur to you?!</string>
  <string id="13700">What are you talking about, Comrade Weinberg?</string>
  <string id="13701">You made changes to the firmware and replaced the vaccine that we injected the clones with!</string>
  <string id="13702">What - cat got your tongue? Didn't think I'd find out? You can't hide from me! You're done for, Redgrave! Who ordered you to sabotage everything?</string>
  <string id="13703">It wasn’t an order - he asked! His name is Horatio Newport. He came from the future to prevent a global catastrophe.</string>
  <string id="13704">Evan, are you drunk? What future? What disaster? You were taken advantage of to commit sabotage, then framed and ratted out as soon as it started to smell bad.</string>
  <string id="13705">You think so?</string>
  <string id="13706">You are a spectacular imbecile.</string>
  <string id="13707">I’m willing to do everything I can and dedicate every effort, every skill, to fix my mistake!</string>
  <string id="13708">No, no. I won't let you go anywhere near these matters anymore.</string>
  <string id="13709">What should I do now?</string>
  <string id="13710">Go for now. Work. I will deal with your mess.</string>
  <string id="13711">But I will transfer Newport to a better place. With thick walls, and away from prying eyes.</string>
  <string id="13712">You took the results of this whole floor’s many months of hard work, and flushed them down the toilet. And you’re expecting a pat on the head?</string>
  <string id="13713">No, Redgrave. We do not forgive such mistakes.</string>
  <string id="13714">I'm sorry I liked you. I respected your father, but... You have to answer for your actions yourself.</string>
  <string id="13715">Security! Take this idiot away.</string>
  <string id="13716">Comrade Weinberg, may I talk to you about a personal matter?</string>
  <string id="13717">In general, I don’t welcome these things. But since you're here...</string>
  <string id="13718">I won't take long. We have a lot of biomaterial left after the experiments on the clones. Can I keep their internal organs?</string>
  <string id="13719">Why do you need internal organs? For experiments? But you're not a scientist.</string>
  <string id="13720">There’s a place where they could do a lot of good. The chemical plant has poisoned everything around it, and people are getting sick.</string>
  <string id="13721">Do you want to transplant organs into people who are going to die from pollution anyway? What's the point? Evolution has made its choice!</string>
  <string id="13722">But these are human beings! It's not their fault the plant was built there. Stephen Dawking is trying to somehow alleviate their fate, but he lacks the resources, so I decided to help.</string>
  <string id="13723">Hmmm...</string>
  <string id="13724">Okay. You helped me solve the problem with Carl Zero, so I’ll help you. Let Dawking come to see me somehow, and we’ll figure something out.</string>
  <string id="13725">Evan, I believe I also asked you to help me?</string>
  <string id="13726">-&gt;$13783</string>
  <string id="13727">So then why are you asking me for a favor in return, having not yet done a thing for me? Do what I asked, and then we'll talk. Okay?</string>
  <string id="13728">-&gt;$13392</string>
  <string id="13729">Comrade Weinberg, why do we need so many clones?</string>
  <string id="13730">Strange question, Evan! Where else can we find so many able-bodied men to meet the needs of the economy? We’re at war, if you haven’t noticed!</string>
  <string id="13731">Well then, why not send the clones to be soldiers, instead of ordinary people?!</string>
  <string id="13732">Do you know how much it costs to make a clone? Losing people is much more cost-effective.</string>
  <string id="13733">-&gt;$13422</string>
  <string id="13734">Isaac, how did you end up on this floor?</string>
  <string id="13735">I didn’t - I created it. Everything you see around you is my creation, my life! I know every cell in every clone, I know every single Carl just by looking at them!</string>
  <string id="13736">I must admit... Sometimes I even come here to talk to them.</string>
  <string id="13737">Do they respond?</string>
  <string id="13738">Of course not. But I’m happy to sit here in silence and think about a better world...</string>
  <string id="13739">Discuss areas of research</string>
  <string id="13740">Comrade Weinberg, what are you working on at the moment?</string>
  <string id="13741">I’m preparing the launch of a new generation of clones. We managed to eliminate almost all the bugs in the previous version - there are still a couple of little things left over, like hiccups, tickling, and a love of cats.</string>
  <string id="13742">-&gt;$5706</string>
  <string id="13743">It’s odd, but all Carls just love cats. And we just can’t do anything about it.</string>
  <string id="13744">Discuss the future</string>
  <string id="13745">Comrade Weinberg, do you think that the clones will really make our future better?</string>
  <string id="13746">Of course. What were you expecting? Everything bad about our current society comes from people. Laziness, anger, aggression, love...</string>
  <string id="13747">Is love a bad thing?</string>
  <string id="13748">When love interferes with the fulfillment of work quotas, it certainly is bad! We'll fill the world with ideal creatures, and when there are enough of them, people will realize how beautiful it is to live in a perfectly constructed world!</string>
  <string id="13749">And what happens next?</string>
  <string id="13750">I hope by then that society will develop to the point of voluntarily giving this planet over to the clones. But until then, Evan, we still have to work and work!</string>
  <string id="13751">-&gt;$6697</string>
  <string id="13752">You said you knew my father...</string>
  <string id="13753">Yes, Evan. Caleb and I were close - two bright minds, two geniuses, two brilliant scientists... Of course, we always had something to talk about or argue about... He often came to me for advice, and I never turned him away.</string>
  <string id="13754">Do you know what happened to him?</string>
  <string id="13755">You know, for the last while your father was very thoughtful... Sullen, I’d even say. Maybe he realized that his way of correcting reality wasn’t as good as mine, and just couldn’t accept it?</string>
  <string id="13756">His way?</string>
  <string id="13757">Oh yes... Sorry. You’re not supposed to know about that.</string>
  <string id="14878">Talk about the throne room</string>
  <string id="14879">Tell me about the throne room.</string>
  <string id="14880">What do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="14881">Ask about the giant statue of the Leader</string>
  <string id="14882">Is it me, or does this statue violate the rules regarding portrayals of the Leader in art?</string>
  <string id="14883">Umm... This is an unfinished work. There’ll be.. Well, you'll see.</string>
  <string id="14884">Of course! This is a statue of me! “Isaac the Father on the heavenly throne”. When I finish my work, the clones will worship this statue and worship me as a god!</string>
  <string id="14885">Tell me about Carl Zero</string>
  <string id="14886">What is Carl Zero doing here?</string>
  <string id="14887">Although we use him as a benchmark, there are still a lot of issues with him. We still haven’t managed to iron out some bugs in his firmware.</string>
  <string id="14888">He’s waiting to assume his place in history! I fixed the bugs in his firmware, and now he is the perfect specimen!</string>
  <string id="14889">You know, you can take pride in the fact that you helped me with this successful experiment, I authorize it!</string>
  <string id="14890">This is my lab! But I call it the throne room. This is where the future of our country lies! If everything goes well, I will tell you more about it.</string>
  <string id="14891">Comrade Weinberg!</string>

  <string id="14895">Hello, Carl! I'm so sick of it!</string>
  <string id="14896">Well, here we are. Everything that you see is the result of well-coordinated work between man and clone!</string>
  <string id="15122">-&gt;$15121</string>
  <string id="15123">-&gt;$15119</string>
  <string id="15129">Comrade Weinberg! I read your book and I’d like to ask you…</string>
  <string id="15130">You made the right choice! Which one? I have many excellent publications to my name! There was supposed to be another one recently, but some problems cropped up with “The Path of the Leader”…</string>
  <string id="15131">I read the Canon of Clones.</string>
  <string id="15132">The Canon... What? How?! Impossible!</string>
  <string id="15133">It was just lying there out in the open and...</string>
  <string id="15134">So you’re not even trying to hide the fact that you stole it!</string>
  <string id="15135">It wasn’t that simple!</string>
  <string id="15136">You have tasted the fruit of forbidden knowledge! Security! Take him away and station a guard at the entrance to my office.</string>
  <string id="15137">I read the Canon of Clones.</string>
  <string id="15138">Are you joking, Evan?! It’s not some two-line propaganda flyer! Did you really read it?</string>
  <string id="15139">Such speed! Incredible...</string>
  <string id="13758">-&gt;$14893</string>
  <string id="13759">Hello! How can I help?</string>
  <string id="13760">I need to inject you with this vaccine.</string>
  <string id="13761">Intervention in the biochemical processes of clones is permitted only with proper authorization.</string>
  <string id="13762">Vaccinate</string>
  <string id="13763">Is my authority enough?</string>
  <string id="13764">Admission received. Ready for the procedure</string>
  <string id="13765">Your authorization level is insufficient</string>
  <string id="13766">-&gt;$6265</string>
  <string id="15126">Instructions from Dr. Newport received. Ready for the procedure</string>
  <string id="13767">Evan Redgrave, you are accused of killing Horatio Newport!</string>
  <string id="13768">What the hell... I didn’t do anything!</string>
  <string id="13769">You have a gun in your hands, Redgrave! You’re not going to weasel your way out of this!</string>
  <string id="13770">He shot himself! He came back from the future, tried to talk me into it - but I refused - then he killed Newport and disappeared!</string>
  <string id="13771">Right... From the future, of course. Killed himself, then disappeared...</string>
  <string id="13772">Yes!</string>
  <string id="13773">We’ve heard better fairy tales, Redgrave. So let's not bother with the stupid stuff.</string>
  <string id="13774">-&gt;$8092</string>
  <string id="13775">But it really wasn’t me! What can I do to convince you?</string>
  <string id="13776">We need evidence. Hard evidence. The kind that makes a rustling sound.</string>
  <string id="13777">Sure, I’ve got it! Just a minute... Here, exactly 5000 bits of evidence for you. Is that enough?</string>
  <string id="13778">You should’ve told us you had an alibi at the start! I won’t detain you any further.</string>
  <string id="13779">I can pay!</string>
  <string id="13780">What? Bribing officials? Are you kidding me, Redgrave? Why aggravate your crime?</string>
  <string id="13781">-&gt;$10147</string>
  <string id="13782">It isn’t stupid! Instead of throwing unsubstantiated accusations, try investigating all the possibilities!</string>
  <string id="13784">-&gt;$13783</string>
  <string id="13785">Do I need to teach you how to do your own job? Perhaps I should contact your superiors?</string>
  <string id="13786">My bad. I was mistaken. Sorry to bother you, Comrade Redgrave!</string>
  <string id="13787">Leave.</string>
  <string id="13788">Yesterday I detained the Minister of Health for drug use in the workplace. So your regalia and merits are of no interest to me at all.</string>
  <string id="13789">Accept unjust punishment</string>
  <string id="13790">Is there any point in arguing?</string>
  <string id="13791">None whatsoever.</string>
  <string id="13792">Bribe?</string>
  <string id="13793">You don’t have enough money.</string>
  <string id="13794">Connections?</string>
  <string id="13795">My uncle is the deputy minister. Stop talking, Redgrave. It’s game over!</string>
  <string id="13796">What does all of this mean?</string>
  <string id="13797">It means that we’re arresting you, former Comrade Weinberg.</string>
  <string id="13798">You? This is nonsense! You can't arrest me! I am a world-famous scientist! I am the head of this floor! I am the head scientist in the cloning project! The Leader himself appointed me here!</string>
  <string id="13799">Times change, Isaac. You crossed the line of trust when you decided to create a cult around yourself.</string>
  <string id="13800">A cult? Around myself? Nonsense!</string>
  <string id="13801">What about the Canon of Clones? Didn't you want to become a god?</string>
  <string id="13802">How... Redgrave! Is this your doing, Redgrave, you lousy bastard?! Telling everyone about the Canon of Clones? What have you done! You could have been a prophet! You could have keep the memory of your name alive for centuries! I trusted you! You deceived me!</string>
  <string id="13803">I'm tired of his shouting. Take this genius away and shut his mouth so that he can’t say anything to the guards.</string>
  <string id="13804">Good work, Evan! The country and the Leader thank you.</string>
  <string id="13805">Yes, but I didn’t even come close to solving the mystery of my father’s death.</string>
  <string id="13806">That’s where you are mistaken. You're one step away from it.</string>
  <string id="13807">What?! How?!</string>
  <string id="13808">I think that after today's success the Great Leader will allow you a visit.</string>
  <string id="13809">Me?! But.. What will I say to him? And what does the death of my father have to do with it?</string>
  <string id="13810">All in good time. When you receive your invitation, contact me. I'll explain everything.</string>
  <string id="13811">Deal, James. I’ll be sure to call you.</string>
  <string id="13812">Excellent. Once again, congratulations on a job well done!</string>
  <string id="15331">How do you know about that? Where did you get my book? Answer me!</string>
  <string id="13813">Comrade Redgrave. Comrade Weinberg wants to see you.</string>
  <string id="13814">-&gt;$12299</string>
  <string id="13918">Hello, Evan.</string>
  <string id="13919">Hemnitz?! What?! What the hell?! How?! Why?!</string>
  <string id="13920">From your exclamations it’s hard to tell what you’re more stunned by: Cunningham’s tragic death or my own miraculous resurrection.</string>
  <string id="13921">I dare say both events are equally shocking to you, so I’ll give you some time to have a look around.</string>
  <string id="13922">I’m sure you figured a lot of things out as you scrambled your way to the top, but I imagine you still have a lot of questions. Ask away. We have plenty of time.</string>
  <string id="13923">Just please don't do anything stupid. I have enough rounds left in this gun to put you next to Cunningham eight times over.</string>
  <string id="13924">Who are you, really?</string>
  <string id="13925">Who are you?</string>
  <string id="13926">I'm George Hemnitz. And now, without any false modesty, I can say that I am the smartest member of the Inner Circle.</string>
  <string id="13927">Inner Circle?</string>
  <string id="13928">That's what we call the elite group of people who really govern this country.</string>
  <string id="13929">The rest all laughed at me. They saw my return to being a senior manager in the citizens’ appeal department as a foolish flight of fancy. They even came up with a word for it: “downshifting”.</string>
  <string id="13930">But only there, down below, can you see all the vulnerabilities of the system. Only by pretending to be one of the mere mortals could I find ways to access other structures, such as the Internal Investigations Division.</string>
  <string id="13931">All it took was a little dirt scraped from the very bottom: just 342 incoherent reports, a little indirect evidence of the rest of the Inner Circle being corrupt (14 blurry photos, to be exact) - and that was it! James Aldous Cunningham took the bait and started digging.</string>
  <string id="13932">-&gt;$14048</string>
  <string id="13933">Tell me about the Inner Circle.</string>
  <string id="13934">Me, Ferguson, DeSalvo, Weinberg and your father. That's the whole Inner Circle.</string>
  <string id="13935">What about the Wise Leader? Doesn't he rule everything?</string>
  <string id="13936">Ahahahaha! Evan! Are you really that much of a fool?! That old loon never ruled anything! It’s been that way from the very beginning!</string>
  <string id="13937">What?!</string>
  <string id="13938">Just wait - you’ll still have a chance to chat with him today. And why not! You’ve definitely earned you “audience”.</string>
  <string id="13939">Ask about Hemnitz’s execution</string>
  <string id="13940">How is this possible? You were executed! I saw you hanged in public with my own eyes!</string>
  <string id="13941">You weren’t the only one who witnessed it - and that was the point. There was nothing supernatural about it: bribes for the guards, a climbing safety rig under my jacket, a couple of clasps and a hook for the noose.</string>
  <string id="13942">The really hard part was having to hang there without moving after that little show for the following 18 hours and 43 minutes.</string>
  <string id="13944">-&gt;$13943</string>
  <string id="13945">You know, you seem like a smart man - you made your way to the top, after all. And yet you still don't get some very simple things. Strange.</string>
  <string id="13946">It's so the others think I’m no longer around. My rivals are more dangerous than yours, Evan.</string>
  <string id="13947">What rivals?</string>
  <string id="13948">Ferguson, DeSalvo, Weinberg. While I was “dead”, they were competing with each other, thinking that they didn’t have to worry about anyone else behind their backs.</string>
  <string id="13949">Ask about Cunningham</string>
  <string id="13950">Why did you kill him?</string>
  <string id="13951">Nothing personal. Cunningham had played his part, and therefore it was time to remove him. He’d become waste material.</string>
  <string id="13952">And what was his part?</string>
  <string id="13953">He may have mentioned that he had a superior. I was that superior, although he never once saw me and he received all his orders by telephone.</string>
  <string id="13954">I don’t think he ever even guessed that the first circumstantial evidence he found on the Inner Circle also came from me.</string>
  <string id="13955">He used you, and I used him to eliminate my competitors and gain access to the Heimdall project through you.</string>
  <string id="13956">Ask about the Heimdall project</string>
  <string id="13957">What is this project? What’s the purpose of it?</string>
  <string id="13958">To control people. Using repeater towers spread throughout the city, 2,841 of them altogether, connected to a single network. If you adjust the wavelength properly, and send a signal, you can make people do anything you like.</string>
  <string id="13959">What’s more, it’s possible to create more complex patterns and command different people to do different things. You can make ordinary people obey and not complain, make soldiers go to war, make workers work. You can command everyone to be happy, and they’ll be happy.</string>
  <string id="13960">Or, you can order everyone to voluntarily go to the nearest Euthanasia Center and free up some space.</string>
  <string id="13961">One way or another, each individual will become a link in one great chain, part of a self-sustaining system that sees everything and hears everything. This is Heimdall.</string>
  <string id="13962">-&gt;$11931</string>
  <string id="13963">Was my father involved?</string>
  <string id="13964">Your father worked on Heimdall. Not by himself, of course. He was a talented administrator and politician, but no scientist.</string>
  <string id="13965">He did achieve a real breakthrough - his team discovered how to completely block the signal for individual recipients.</string>
  <string id="13966">Without this, there would have been no point to the project - the entirety of the powerful elite would also be under the influence of the signal.</string>
  <string id="13967">I, for one, didn’t much fancy becoming a slobbering idiot, jumping through hoops for whoever’s standing at the control panel.</string>
  <string id="13968">Put simply, Heimdall is as much Caleb Redgrave's child as you are. And considering the fact that you and your father barely spoke to each other, I could not unequivocally say which of you he loved more.</string>
  <string id="13969">Ask about the bosses of the other floors</string>
  <string id="13970">Why was it necessary to get me to deal with the bosses?</string>
  <string id="13971">As I said, I needed someone to help get rid of my competitors.</string>
  <string id="13972">Let's discuss how well that went.</string>
  <string id="13973">Ferguson...</string>
  <string id="13974">Thanks to you, that pompous turkey of a man will be kept very busy digging holes for pools he'll never get to swim in.</string>
  <string id="13975">Great work!</string>
  <string id="13976">I don’t know why you decided to let that idiot remain free. Did he bribe you with a swimming pool full of caviar and women? The man has no imagination whatsoever. I thought better of you, Evan.</string>
  <string id="13977">As for DeSalvo...</string>
  <string id="13978">A pure psychopath who should have been put down like a rabid dog a long time ago. Of course, I can’t say I haven’t gotten my hands dirty from time to time, but I believe that violence should be justified and... functional...</string>
  <string id="13979">The things he did were inexcusable and unforgivable! You did everyone a favor by putting an end to it all.</string>
  <string id="13980">I’m not inclined to judge you... Tell me, are you mesmerized by this man’s obsession with the pain of others? Or are you just scared of him? Well, it doesn’t matter. You left DeSalvo free to his own devices in the Ministry. You shouldn't have.</string>
  <string id="13981">And as for Weinberg...</string>
  <string id="13982">Things got out of hand with that clown and his clones. Let him see what an ideal society truly looks like! You were right not to get swept up in his ideas - we'd be heading for a future overrun with clones, otherwise.</string>
  <string id="13983">I think it’s only fitting that he serve as biomaterial to help create the clones he loved so much.</string>
  <string id="13984">Did you consider him to be a real man of science? Or did you honestly buy into his utopian ideas about the perfect world order? Why the hell did you leave this lunatic free to continue his work? I think even your father would be disappointed...</string>
  <string id="13985">And as for where that leaves us...</string>
  <string id="13986">My plan was a good one. It's just that you are either stupid, lazy, or gullible. The entire Inner Circle is on the loose, continuing to squabble over power. You were an opportunity wasted, Evan.</string>
  <string id="13987">It didn’t go quite as smoothly as I’d imagined, but you get what you get. Isn’t that right?</string>
  <string id="13988">You can look at it in different ways. Not all of the Inner Circle have been eliminated - now that doesn't sound very positive, does it? I like to think differently: part of the Inner Circle has been eliminated.</string>
  <string id="13989">Not bad, of course, but you could have done better, Evan!</string>
  <string id="13990">You did a superlative job! Well done! You played your part in my symphony without missing a single note! You’re the star performer!</string>
  <string id="13991">The Inner Circle has been eliminated, and now I’m the only one left! I’ll be sure to give you a Certificate of Merit for all your hard work, Evan Redgrave!</string>
  <string id="13992">Ahahahaha!</string>
  <string id="13994">-&gt;$13993</string>
  <string id="13995">How did my dad die?</string>
  <string id="13996">I’ll make no secret of the fact that Caleb posed a problem for all of us. What he was developing had the potential to not just shake the scales of power; Heimdall was capable of simply smashing the scales into dust.</string>
  <string id="13997">And opinions on the matter differed. Some didn’t believe that such a project could actually be completed. Some wanted to wait until development was finished so that they could take it for themselves. And some were quite content with the current balance of power.</string>
  <string id="13998">But then the first test exceeded our wildest expectations - it was 100% effective! But your father - and this was a surprise - suddenly grew a conscience!</string>
  <string id="13999">So you all had him killed! Who was the one who did it? You?</string>
  <string id="14000">I think he was just trying to protect you. None of us had any qualms about harming each others’ families, after all...</string>
  <string id="14001">You won’t believe me, of course - and why should you? But your father jumped out that window himself.</string>
  <string id="14002">You’re right - I don’t believe a word of it.</string>
  <string id="14003">You don’t have to believe it. You can watch the surveillance camera footage yourself. From the terminal. The password is Icarus.</string>
  <string id="14004">Ask why I’m here</string>
  <string id="14005">I understand all of that, but what does it have to do with me, damn it?</string>
  <string id="14006">The threat of the death of his son would have been enough to get Caleb to give up and hand over access to the first person to get to you.</string>
  <string id="14007">So he was clever about it: he tuned Heimdall to your biometrics, DNA and vital signs. Then, he killed himself. So you are the only person in the world who can activate the program.</string>
  <string id="14008">But why he stashed those boxes with launch codes all over the Ministry - which, again, only you can open - I do not quite understand.</string>
  <string id="14009">So, you have to be alive, healthy and calm - that is, not in pain or under stress - to launch Heimdall.</string>
  <string id="14010">That's why you weren’t dragged to this office right away. That’s why the boss of each the floor tried, let's say... to draw you into the orbit of their interests.</string>
  <string id="14011">Ask about father's letter</string>
  <string id="14012">Father's first letter. You wrote it, right?</string>
  <string id="14013">Let's just say I edited it a little... The original was much more voluminous. Caleb described the Inner Circle, Heimdall, and his plans in detail.</string>
  <string id="14014">But the phrase: “Don’t trust anyone” belongs to him. You should have listened to your father, Evan.</string>
  <string id="14015">I should have known.</string>
  <string id="14016">You’re right about that! I even thought back then... Does this guy really have no questions? Like, “Why the hell is dad writing in riddles, instead of just telling everything like it is?”</string>
  <string id="14017">By the way, you have a big mouth, Evan. You told Cunningham about me and the letter immediately! And I asked you to keep everything secret!</string>
  <string id="14018">By the way, you know how to keep secrets, Evan. You didn’t tell Cunningham about me. Not that it matters, but I am pleased that you fulfilled my request.</string>
  <string id="14019">Finish that trip down the memory lane, and let's get down to business.</string>
  <string id="14020">Ask what Hemnitz wants</string>
  <string id="14021">Each of the bosses wanted something. What do you want?</string>
  <string id="14022">Me? What do you think I want?</string>
  <string id="14023">Something tells me that a person whose mind could weave such a plan to eliminate competitors doesn’t simply want to “enjoy the power”.</string>
  <string id="14024">Well... Cards on the table, right?</string>
  <string id="14025">-&gt;$14362</string>
  <string id="14026">I've been here for many years... in this muddy pool of yours that you call the Great State for some unfathomable reason.</string>
  <string id="14027">What could be so great about such a colossal mound of shit? You’re like maggots - crawling around in the garbage, incapable of imagining anything better!</string>
  <string id="14028">What use is your freedom if you don’t know what to do with it? You yourselves gave it up to a handful of wicked people many years ago.</string>
  <string id="14029">And it would've been fine if you only poisoned your own lives. But you’ve built everything around the fact that someone else is to blame!</string>
  <string id="14030">Everything from economics to demographics is tied to a war with your neighbors, who are also responsible, it turns out, for your inability to go and do something about it!</string>
  <string id="14031">Oh my God! You’re a mole! A Borean?!</string>
  <string id="14032">I’ve forgotten who I am over the years. But I have not forgotten that I want to end this damned war that continues to take so many lives.</string>
  <string id="14033">That’s why I’m here, Evan. I want to use Heimdall to stop this meat grinder!</string>
  <string id="14034">So that your people and my people can safely build our own happiness.</string>
  <string id="14035">Ask about the Leader</string>
  <string id="14036">You said that the Wise Leader doesn’t decide anything...</string>
  <string id="14037">Oh yes. You have a unique opportunity to see the Wise, Great, Fair Leader exactly how he really is.</string>
  <string id="14038">If you're going to weep in disappointment, don’t do it too loud...</string>
  <string id="14039">There's a button in the terminal... the password is “Organic Vegetable”. Ahahaha! You’ll appreciate the joke soon enough!</string>
  <string id="14040">Well then, Evan. It's time to do what you’ve spent so much time working towards.</string>
  <string id="14041">Now you will launch Heimdall and hand control over to me.</string>
  <string id="14042">And don’t try anything funny - I still have the revolver. I can live without Heimdall. You can't live without your head.</string>
  <string id="15397">Where did we leave off?</string>
  <string id="14043">Hello...</string>
  <string id="14044">Hello. Is that you, Caleb? No... You look a lot like him...</string>
  <string id="14045">I'm his son. I... I have so many questions for you. I don't even know where to start.</string>
  <string id="14046">I'm sorry to disappoint you, young man, but I don't know very much. I... will have something to ask of you, but that’s for later...</string>
  <string id="14047">In the meantime, ask your questions. If I can, I will answer.</string>
  <string id="14049">-&gt;$14048</string>
  <string id="14050">Do you know about the Inner Circle? Do you even know what’s going on in the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="14051">I have no idea what you’re talking about... These people don’t really ask for my opinion. And why would they...</string>
  <string id="14052">What? You’re the Wise Leader!</string>
  <string id="14053">And what does that mean? The Wise Leader is an image, nothing more.</string>
  <string id="14054">You are the Father of the Nation, the Leader of the Great State. The Conscience, Mind and Honor of Our Era!</string>
  <string id="14055">Ugh... I want to tell you a story. It’s hard to believe, but once - a very, very, very long time ago - I was a teenager. Fantasy books were incredibly popular at the time. Kind of like fairy tales for adults... Have you ever read anything like that?</string>
  <string id="14056">Those kinds of books are banned. They say that every citizen must build a real life, not live in fantasies.</string>
  <string id="14057">Well, when I was young, these books were everywhere. And the hardest part was finding the good stories among all the rest. My friend told me the simplest way of identifying the bad ones.</string>
  <string id="14058">You have to read the description on the back. And if you come across a sentence containing more than three words that start with a capital letter, the book is most likely rubbish. This technique still works almost a hundred percent of the time.</string>
  <string id="14059">I hope you now understand why I'm quite sick and tired of all these Wise Leaders, Consciences, Minds, and so on?</string>
  <string id="14060">Why don’t you do anything?</string>
  <string id="14061">You just lie here while injustices happen all around you? In your own name?!</string>
  <string id="14062">What can I do? I have long been just a tired old man who can’t even move more than a hundred steps away from these machines.</string>
  <string id="14063">Would you like to hear how I became the Wise Leader?</string>
  <string id="14064">I was an aspiring theatre actor when the revolution started. I mostly played small parts - the most humiliating experience I ever had was portraying a corpse for three hours. Seems ironic now, doesn’t it?</string>
  <string id="14065">So, the revolutionaries stormed the theatre during one of those shows and shot dead every actor for “worshipping bourgeois values”. They left me alone, seeing as I was already acting dead.</string>
  <string id="14066">A week later, I encountered them again on the street. They were shocked - they must've remembered my face.</string>
  <string id="14067">Then someone yelled, “It's a miracle!”, and before I knew it, I was put on a pedestal to give a speech.</string>
  <string id="14068">Either out of fear, or relief, I got carried away with it. Turns out I was great at making rousing speeches!</string>
  <string id="14069">Within a fortnight, I was the face of the revolution! And, as you can guess, it became my job to speak someone else's words from a stage, inspiring and motivating others.</string>
  <string id="14070">I was a nobody. And I remained a nobody. Just an echo.</string>
  <string id="14071">At least now I don't have to play dead anymore. As you can see, I already look much deader than any corpse.</string>

  <string id="14074">What is all this? Why are you here? What are the organs in those tubes for?</string>
  <string id="14075">I'm over 100 years old. They continue to transplant failing organs into me and keep me hooked up to life support.</string>
  <string id="14076">The worst thing is, nobody cares what I want. When they don't need me, they put me in an induced coma.</string>
  <string id="14077">When they do need me, usually to record yet another propaganda video, they raise me from the dead.</string>
  <string id="14078">Why? Wouldn’t it be less trouble to use lookalikes?</string>
  <string id="14079">We had those for a time. But they all wanted something: money, women, or just to get drunk all the time… After a couple of unfortunate incidents, it was decided to just go back to the one person who already accepted his fate long ago.</string>
  <string id="14080">I'm not blind. I'm easily replaceable. They just don't want to go to the effort.</string>
  <string id="14081">What request?</string>
  <string id="14082">You said you had a request of me?</string>
  <string id="14083">I understand that asking this from a stranger is too much. But there might be no other chance.</string>
  <string id="14084">I'm so tired. I'm so sick of myself... So many years have passed, and I'm still the same soulless talking machine...</string>
  <string id="14085">I want you to kill me.</string>
  <string id="14086">-&gt;$9388</string>
  <string id="14087">Kill me. I beg you. Stop this meaningless agony. After all, so many people have been deprived of their organs to support my life.</string>
  <string id="14088">And I'm just a scratched-up turntable playing the same record over and over again.</string>
  <string id="14089">Unplugging me is pointless; those life supports have a great many safeguards. Just take a pillow…</string>
  <string id="14090">Kill me, friend. Do the right thing. End my suffering…</string>

  <string id="14092">Okay, I will help you. I'm sorry.</string>

  <string id="14094">-&gt;$6920</string>
  <string id="14095">I'm so sorry, but I just can't.</string>

  <string id="14097">Great job, Redgrave! A real breakthrough!</string>
  <string id="14098">I won't let you bastards have Heimdall! You’ll all only make things worse! To hell with you!</string>

  <string id="14119">I'm not an interpreter!</string>
  <string id="14120">I know. You are Evan. Your names I know. Who are you?</string>
  <string id="14121">I'm just your colleague!</string>

  <string id="14123">Is good to see you!</string>

  <string id="14132">-&gt;$14131</string>
  <string id="14133">-&gt;$6747</string>
  <string id="14134">Maria, to be honest, I studied your language to find out why you aren't working.</string>
  <string id="14135">I not working?!</string>
  <string id="14136">Yes, Oliver Vertinsky says that you work in neuroscience and genetics, and that DNA is a universal language that doesn't need translating. He expects some results from you.</string>
  <string id="14137">Universal language? If jailer beat Oliver every night, all languages he would have forgotten!</string>
  <string id="14138">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="14139">All day I sit and wait for the night with fear. I cannot write. I cannot read. I cannot do anything.</string>
  <string id="14140">-&gt;$6661</string>
  <string id="14141">At night, guard comes... Angry. Bad. Nobody sees.</string>
  <string id="14142">Is the guard beating you?! Why didn't you say anything?! Oh, yeah…</string>
  <string id="14143">I tried to make report. No one understands. I'm scared. No way out.</string>
  <string id="14144">This is unacceptable! I won't let it stand! Either he’ll leave you on his own, or I’ll find a way to reign him in and he will regret it!</string>
  <string id="14145">No, Evan! It will be worse! I cannot stand it!</string>
  <string id="14146">Don't worry! Given the kind of hurdles I had to overcome to make it to this floor, it’ll take more than some guard to stop me!</string>
  <string id="14147">Maria, I see that they gave you an interpreter.</string>
  <string id="14148">Yes. Now I can ask to go to the bathroom or tell them if something hurts.</string>
  <string id="14149">Then why are you so sad?</string>
  <string id="14150">Because my soul hurts, Evan!</string>
  <string id="14151">-&gt;$6088</string>
  <string id="14152">I'm with a child.</string>
  <string id="14153">Whoa. How could that happen?! You don't know anyone here!</string>
  <string id="14154">The guard.</string>
  <string id="14155">Oh… I’m sorry… So what now?</string>
  <string id="14156">I don't know. His child I don't want to keep. But this is also my child. My child is not my enemy! Evan, what should I do?</string>
  <string id="14157">About the child…</string>
  <string id="14158">Suggest running away</string>
  <string id="14159">I don't think the interpreter is as well-trained as the guard you had. You can try to escape.</string>
  <string id="14160">And then what?</string>
  <string id="14161">Get on a freight train, get to the border, maybe even cross it. Give birth to your child at home, in peace and quiet.</string>
  <string id="14162">You say it so easy, but it is difficult. And scary!</string>
  <string id="14163">Scare her with possible consequences</string>
  <string id="14164">But if you don't run away, everyone will soon find out that you’re pregnant, and when the child is born, they’ll surely take them to the House of Misfits.</string>
  <string id="14165">The House of Misfits? What is it?</string>
  <string id="14166">A terrible place, Maria, believe me. And they’ll probably lock you up!</string>
  <string id="14167">Take my child away? Lock me up? Evan, I agree. I need to run!</string>
  <string id="14168">I’ll try to explain everything so that it's easier for you.</string>
  <string id="14169">Thank you, Evan! The kindest here was you!</string>
  <string id="14170">You're welcome, Maria! Good luck!</string>
  <string id="14171">Think of other options</string>
  <string id="14172">Suggest contacting the embassy</string>
  <string id="14173">Have you tried to contact your country's embassy? Maybe they can help.</string>
  <string id="14174">How? I do not have phone! How do I call?</string>
  <string id="14175">Call yourself</string>
  <string id="14176">I can call them from my phone and tell them about you.</string>
  <string id="14177">You can do that?</string>
  <string id="14178">Of course, it’s no trouble.</string>
  <string id="14179">Is dangerous!</string>
  <string id="14180">I'll be careful, don't worry!</string>
  <string id="14181">Evan, thank you! You my savior!</string>
  <string id="14182">Wait, let's try to get you out first. Then we'll talk.</string>
  <string id="14183">Advise her not to keep the child</string>
  <string id="14184">You don’t have to keep your rapist’s child, Maria. Especially if you think that it’ll always remind you of all the hurt, humiliation and pain. Can you live with that?</string>
  <string id="14185">You are right, Evan.</string>
  <string id="14186">So what do you plan to do?</string>
  <string id="14187">I cannot go to doctor. I have the medicines, but... I am sacred. What if something goes bad?</string>
  <string id="14189">-&gt;$14188</string>
  <string id="14190">You’re a geneticist, Maria - you know the human body better than anyone in this building. Surely you know how to administer the drugs properly?</string>
  <string id="14191">You are right, Evan. I am a scientist. I will manage.</string>
  <string id="14192">I don't doubt it.</string>
  <string id="14193">Keep the child and work hard</string>
  <string id="14194">No child is to blame for the sins of its father. Human life is cheap in this country... If you think you can make your child’s life worth something more, then you should keep it.</string>
  <string id="14195">You think I should give birth?</string>
  <string id="14196">Support her</string>
  <string id="14197">I know you can do it! Just think about your baby gently breathing against your chest.</string>
  <string id="14198">Ah... I am going to cry, Evan! I do really want child!</string>
  <string id="14199">You’ll make a great mother.</string>
  <string id="14200">Mother, me... All my life I dreamed about it. It is pity that everything happened here, but the child is not to blame, yes, Evan?</string>
  <string id="14201">-&gt;$8047</string>
  <string id="14202">Thank you for your support, Evan! I will do as you say!</string>
  <string id="14203">Discuss it another time</string>
  <string id="14204">Maria, have you heard anything about personality testing?</string>
  <string id="14205">Your language is so funny, I hear it as “ha-ha-ha”. “Personality testing” I don't hear.</string>
  <string id="14206">Maria, do you know anything about Carl Zero?</string>
  <string id="14207">I do not know Carl Zero. What is it?</string>
  <string id="14208">Not what, who. The man who became the template for our clones.</string>
  <string id="14209">I did not work with your clones. I not know who is Carl Zero. I saw only tests. By chance. Looking at adrenaline stats, I can say Carl Zero was much afraid and angry a lot.</string>
  <string id="14210">How do you know?</string>
  <string id="14211">I saw test results next to biocontainers before download of firmware. High adrenaline. This is him, Carl Zero, inside.</string>
  <string id="14212">Biocontainers?</string>
  <string id="14213">Clones. With no firmware. The consciousness is suppressed, but subconscious is afraid and angry.</string>
  <string id="14214">Ask how she's doing</string>
  <string id="14215">How are you doing, Maria?</string>
  <string id="14216">Very good. After I decided to keep child, the interpreter offered me friendship. He said he liked me. And my baby.</string>
  <string id="14217">Great. Does he hurt you?</string>
  <string id="14218">All men hurt. But this one is better than previous one.</string>
  <string id="14219">That makes sense.</string>
  <string id="14220">I feel like I have wings! It is over, you know? Again I can work, I can do science!</string>
  <string id="14221">I'm happy for you, Maria!</string>
  <string id="14222">Thank you, Evan! You really helped me! It is time for me to go. See you again! And how do you say? Glory to the Leader!</string>
  <string id="14223">-&gt;$8183</string>
  <string id="14224">I did it with my own hands. Killed the enemy.</string>
  <string id="14225">I'm very sorry... How are you?</string>
  <string id="14226">It hurts, Evan. Life is empty. I want to cover myself in work. Forget all.</string>
  <string id="14227">I hope you succeed…</string>
  <string id="14228">A new person they gave me. She knows my language - it is good!</string>
  <string id="14229">I'm glad!</string>
  <string id="14230">Treats me two times better.</string>
  <string id="14231">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="14232">The guard beat me every day. This one does not.</string>
  <string id="14233">Better can be, like they say.</string>
  <string id="14234">“Could be better”, you mean.</string>
  <string id="14235">Yes.</string>
  <string id="14236">Ask about the guard</string>
  <string id="14237">And who is this with you?</string>
  <string id="14238">That is guard. Do not show what we are talking about him!</string>
  <string id="14239">Will be worse. Later. Where they hold me. When people don’t see us. He will ask and hit. Hit and ask. And then, then…</string>
  <string id="14240">Calm down, Maria!</string>
  <string id="14241">Okay, okay... Cannot cry! I can do it!</string>
  <string id="14242">-&gt;$9480</string>
  <string id="14243">Where is your family?</string>
  <string id="14244">My family is in my country.</string>
  <string id="14245">You don't talk to them?</string>
  <string id="14246">Only in my thoughts. They do not give me telephone.</string>
  <string id="14247">Ask about her everyday life</string>
  <string id="14248">Are your living conditions alright?</string>
  <string id="14249">They put me in a house. Together with guard.</string>
  <string id="14250">Do you need anything?</string>
  <string id="14251">Food I have. Life I don't.</string>
  <string id="14252">-&gt;$5706</string>
  <string id="14253">I want to go to home, Evan. Or to die.</string>
  <string id="14254">Ask how she ended up in the Ministry</string>
  <string id="14255">Maria, how did you end up in the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="14256">The special forces of your country took me. I am geneticist and neuroscientist, I gave a report for an international conference.</string>
  <string id="14257">Took you?</string>
  <string id="14258">Yes. From the hotel room. At night. They gave me table, gave me papers, test tubes, microscope. They gave where to sleep. And a guard.</string>
  <string id="14259">Umm… Sorry…</string>
  <string id="14260">-&gt;$15023</string>
  <string id="14261">For everything… It’s…</string>

  <string id="14263">-&gt;$6666</string>
  <string id="14264">Did you ask anyone here for help? Maybe someone else knows your language?</string>
  <string id="14265">I don't know I can to trust, Evan. Maybe you too are a spy and will make it worse for me.</string>
  <string id="14266">I'm not a spy!</string>
  <string id="14267">How do I know? But I cannot be silent anymore, so I want to at least speak my language.</string>

  <string id="14273">Hello, Maria! How are you? Where are you calling from?</string>
  <string id="14274">Evan! The management learned about that I am pregnant! They made me fired from the Ministry! I have no right to give birth without a citizenship.</string>
  <string id="14275">Why don’t you leave?</string>
  <string id="14276">I had no a permission to enter. Without it, I cannot get a permission to leave.</string>
  <string id="14277">What are you going to do?</string>

  <string id="14367">Can you do something about this?</string>
  <string id="14368">Fine, I'll talk to him!</string>
  <string id="14369">Convince him that she needs an interpreter</string>
  <string id="14370">It all comes down to the language barrier. She doesn't understand what’s needed of her, and you won't understand her inventions because you don't know the language.</string>
  <string id="14371">So what do we do?</string>
  <string id="14372">Find an interpreter! I know that there is a problem with them, but if you want her to work, you will have to look for one!</string>
  <string id="14373">And pay a hefty sum! There are almost no interpreters left, and the remaining ones charge a lot…</string>
  <string id="14374">Here, this should be enough.</string>
  <string id="14375">You want to pay for the interpreter?</string>
  <string id="14376">We’re in the same boat, Oliver! I’m willing to do anything for the sake of the Ministry!</string>
  <string id="14377">I don't believe you. But it is commendable. Fine, I'll try to solve this problem.</string>
  <string id="14378">I’d pay myself if I had that kind of money.</string>
  <string id="14379">Yes. A pity that you don't. This would help us a lot…</string>
  <string id="14380">Lie and say that she doesn't want to</string>
  <string id="14381">She’s gone back into her shell.</string>
  <string id="14382">-&gt;$6658</string>
  <string id="14383">She doesn't see any point in cooperating with her kidnappers and giving an advantage to the enemies of her homeland.</string>

  <string id="14388">What if we punish her?</string>
  <string id="14389">As I understand it, she’s a strong woman, so you’re unlikely to achieve anything that way.</string>
  <string id="14390">Well... I did tell those army men that nothing good would come of kidnapping her. And I was right! Looks like we'll have to part ways with her.</string>
  <string id="14391">Part ways how?</string>
  <string id="14392">That doesn't concern you anymore. Thank you, Evan! You’ve been a big help!</string>
  <string id="14393">-&gt;$6705</string>

  <string id="14397">I need more time.</string>
  <string id="14398">Oliver, have you heard anything about the Novichok antidote?</string>
  <string id="14399">Of course I have! Incredible stuff! It completely regenerates all tissues in the body in a few days and removes all toxins! There are side effects, of course, but it is extremely promising.</string>
  <string id="14400">Could you get it for me?</string>
  <string id="14401">What do you need the antidote for?</string>
  <string id="14402">It's not for me. Stephen Dawking says there’s a contaminated village in the suburbs. I want to help those people.</string>
  <string id="14403">Well, yes, Novichok could help... But there’s a catch. Novichok is an experimental drug, and all operations with it are recorded. I don’t want to risk my neck.</string>
  <string id="14404">Buy it for</string>
  <string id="14405">-&gt;$13379</string>
  <string id="14406">Will this help solve the issue?</string>
  <string id="14407">It’s not much, but I'm ready to make any sacrifice if it means saving lives! Dawking will have his Novichok. Tell him to find me so we can discuss the details.</string>

  <string id="14410">We'll talk about it when I have the money.</string>
  <string id="14411">Tell me about the terminals.</string>
  <string id="14412">Oh, they’re a real wonder! Do you know that I helped develop almost every model?</string>
  <string id="14413">No, I didn't! Can you tell me more about them?</string>
  <string id="14414">As much as you want! What do you want to know?</string>
  <string id="14415">Ask about the range of models</string>
  <string id="14416">Why so many different models? Wouldn’t it be easier to put the same terminals everywhere?</string>
  <string id="14417">What do you mean - “the same”? Each model is designed for a specific purpose, configured for a specific employee with a certain level of access. It's no joke!</string>
  <string id="14418">Ask about protection</string>
  <string id="14419">Are they protected?</string>
  <string id="14420">Naturally! Both physically and internally! Several levels, with cross-checks, false data and even... Although why am I telling you this? I wrote a book about it! Want to read it?</string>
  <string id="14421">-&gt;$8047</string>
  <string id="14422">Here you go! It's a rarity - the only copy! Only me and the Leader have one!</string>

  <string id="14424">As you wish! If there’s anything you want to know, just ask.</string>
  <string id="14425">Ask about the design</string>
  <string id="14426">The design was developed by a true genius! A genius! Do you know anything about Ivanito Chikkurito?</string>
  <string id="14427">No, never heard of him.</string>
  <string id="14428">That's because you are an obscurantist and do not understand the art of form! You don't appreciate the beauty of the material world!</string>
  <string id="14429">Have you heard anything about personality testing? I’m wondering just what it involves…</string>
  <string id="14430">It's easy. Only a degenerate couldn't guess the correct answer. And you're not a degenerate, are you?</string>
  <string id="14431">I guess not...</string>
  <string id="14432">So relax!</string>
  <string id="14433">Do you know anything about Carl Zero?</string>
  <string id="14434">Yes, I looked into that at one point... He’s the first clone of a man named Carl Stein. I wanted to know what was so different about him that they decided to make copies.</string>
  <string id="14435">And what did you find out?</string>
  <string id="14436">Nothing. An ordinary middle-aged man with average intelligence and health.</string>
  <string id="14437">You can request the data from the archive if you want. It’s all in there.</string>

  <string id="14442">What can you tell me about Maria Curie?</string>
  <string id="14443">What about her? Good riddance, I say! I’m glad she’s not here anymore - now everyone can work properly!</string>
  <string id="14444">She does her work, and that's good enough for me. Although she seems a little sullen lately.</string>
  <string id="14445">How did we not think of using an interpreter before?</string>
  <string id="14446">Now she does three times as much work!</string>
  <string id="14447">She's ruining all the stats!</string>
  <string id="14448">Talk about Stephen Dawking</string>
  <string id="14449">They hire people from newspaper ads and we are the ones who suffer!</string>
  <string id="14450">How can anyone call him a scientist? He works using quota for the disabled and his brain will burst if he thinks too much! I don’t understand what he's doing here.</string>
  <string id="14451">Talk about Horatio Newport</string>
  <string id="14452">Oh! He may look like a boy, but he has an amazing brain! He's a genius!</string>
  <string id="14453">Is he really that smart?</string>
  <string id="14454">Smart doesn’t begin to describe it! To be frank, he has a shitty personality, but they don't keep us here for our personalities, do they?</string>
  <string id="14455">Talk about Isaac Weinberg</string>
  <string id="14456">If I had a brain like Weinberg's, I wouldn’t be working on terminals. I’d have become the head of this floor a long time ago.</string>
  <string id="14457">Is he a good boss?</string>
  <string id="14458">Good? Perfect! A brilliant scientist managing other brilliant scientists! The quintessence of the human mind!</string>
  <string id="14459">A ridiculous story... Some kind of cult of clones... Well, he had some... hmm... peculiarities, but who doesn't? All geniuses have their eccentricities, and they go and put him in jail! Why? I don’t get it!</string>

  <string id="14473">Do you judge me for that?</string>
  <string id="14474">Not at all! Maria is a very nice girl.</string>
  <string id="14475">Something strange is going on with her. She’s become reserved, silent. I have nothing to interpret anymore! She spends all day at work, and works like crazy.</string>
  <string id="14476">It's the first time I’ve met such a competent native speaker. Even the teachers at our intelligence school didn't talk like that. She has some incredible diphthongoids!</string>

  <string id="14482">I'm an interpreter.</string>
  <string id="14483">How long have you worked as an interpreter?</string>
  <string id="14484">Quite a while. But I used to specialize in geology, and now I have to study genetics because I can’t understand half of what Maria says!</string>
  <string id="14485">Ask about the language</string>
  <string id="14486">How did you learn the language? I heard that everyone who spoke it was executed for being spies?</string>
  <string id="14487">I have a medal from the Leader himself. They wouldn’t dare touch me!</string>
  <string id="14488">What medal?</string>
  <string id="14489">For carrying out a particularly dangerous mission in enemy territory. That's where I learned the language. And when they retired me after my injury, I became an interpreter.</string>

  <string id="14677">Talk about the processed clones</string>
  <string id="14678">I finished the first task!</string>
  <string id="14679">Aren’t you a smart one! Keep on working like that and you'll get paid!</string>
  <string id="14680">So what's next?</string>
  <string id="14681">Oh well... You can do more work, if you want more money... To be honest, I haven't thought about what’s next.</string>
  <string id="14682">Talk about self-development</string>
  <string id="14683">Talk about testing</string>
  <string id="14684">Amelia, have you undergone personality testing?</string>
  <string id="14685">That thing Weinberg makes everyone do?</string>
  <string id="14686">Yes. I’ve been sent to do it. I don't know how to prepare for it.</string>
  <string id="14687">You know, it's so dumb! I was asked what the most expensive thing in the world was. I said it was Lust perfume by the Third Perfume Factory. And it was wrong - imagine that!</string>

  <string id="14690">Evan, did you find anything to help with self-development?</string>
  <string id="14691">Recommend The Word of the Leader</string>
  <string id="14692">Yes, I met one person who had some interesting things to say - perhaps it might suit you. The organization is called The Word of the Leader. They promote personal development through unconditional adherence to the word of our Leader.</string>
  <string id="14693">Sounds interesting, but are you sure?</string>
  <string id="14694">I'm sure. Here, I wrote down the number for you.</string>
  <string id="14695">Thank you, Evan! I'm so grateful!</string>
  <string id="14696">Not sure. I'll think about it, Amelia.</string>
  <string id="14697">Recommend Wings</string>
  <string id="14698">Amelia, I found one very interesting option! A man came to my house with a leaflet about some personal development courses. He was very well-dressed and seemed trustworthy - I think that’s the way to go.</string>
  <string id="14699">Amelia, I'm completely sure! It's the best option, I think they can really help you!</string>

  <string id="14707">I worry that everyone here might be crazy!</string>
  <string id="14708">-&gt;$6661</string>
  <string id="14709">All this science has left them with a few screws loose. Recently I came into work in a low-cut dress, and no one noticed!</string>
  <string id="14710">Talk about the Ministry</string>
  <string id="14711">How did you get into the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="14712">I have to work somewhere! Though I’m not sure why... I got on just fine without it.</string>
  <string id="14713">And how did you get here?</string>
  <string id="14714">Daddy helped me when I graduated from the institute. He said this was a cushy job and I could handle it.</string>
  <string id="14715">And?</string>
  <string id="14716">It’s only been a month. It is cushy.</string>
  <string id="14717">But you're managing to cope, right?</string>
  <string id="14718">Well, I'm not stupid!</string>
  <string id="14719">Talk about private life</string>

  <string id="14722">-&gt;$14291</string>
  <string id="14723">Yeah, relax, you're not my type. It’s just... Everyone here is so smart! Bah!</string>
  <string id="14724">And I'm not one of them?</string>
  <string id="14725">Don't be offended, sweetheart! I just feel like I’m the stupidest person here, and that isn't right! It’s not my fault that our professors gave out grades without us having to take the exams!</string>

  <string id="14728">-&gt;$6189</string>
  <string id="14729">I think you should consider self-development. It'll open new horizons for you!</string>
  <string id="14730">But it's not as easy as it seems. Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="14731">Yeah - you could take some courses, meet new people, make connections, and succeed!</string>
  <string id="14732">Alright! Thank you. If you see any notices about courses, let me know, okay?</string>
  <string id="14734">-&gt;$14733</string>
  <string id="14736">-&gt;$14735</string>
  <string id="14737">Bye.</string>
  <string id="14738">Evan! You mentioned The Word of the Leader - I went there. You should definitely come and listen to the lectures! I'm not afraid of anything anymore, because our Leader watches over his children and protects them from all dangers!</string>
  <string id="14739">Amelia, are you all right?</string>
  <string id="14740">I feel great! I no longer need to suffer, doubt myself, build a career, or think about money. The love of the Leader has filled my heart! I don't need anything anymore!</string>
  <string id="14741">Err… I see. Well, I better get going.</string>
  <string id="14742">Remember, the Leader looks after us and guards us! May his Word be with you!</string>
  <string id="14758">You arrive at 6 Krushvice Street and try to question the tenants about Carl Stein, the previous building manager.</string>
  <string id="14759">Few tenants remain from that time. Currently, they're all gathered in one apartment ready to talk.</string>
  <string id="14760">You find out that Carl’s wife was called Anna. Their son was Patrick, and their daughter was Martha. Everyone in the building loved Martha especially.</string>
  <string id="14761">Talk to the old man</string>
  <string id="14762">This is Mark Ranek, an honored archive worker. He remembers Carl Stein and his family very well.</string>
  <string id="14763">Ask about Anna</string>
  <string id="14764">“A good housewife she was...” are the only words the old man can say.</string>
  <string id="14765">Ask about Patrick</string>
  <string id="14766">He says that while Patrick was a bit of a layabout, he was fond of studying. Carl asked for some books for his son, but Ranek didn't have them. But that good-for-nothing Schimmer did. Carl turned him in to the authorities afterwards, and rightly so.</string>
  <string id="14767">Ask about Martha</string>
  <string id="14768">He says that she was a good girl, but poorly treated. Once she lost her doll, Naira, and went around asking everyone about it. She came knocking at the door three times, and Mark wasn’t able to take a nap after lunch.</string>
  <string id="14769">Talk to the old woman</string>
  <string id="14770">This is Rosa Ranek, a pleasant old lady. It's still unclear how she’s manage to avoid the Blissful Sleep.</string>
  <string id="14771">She says that Anna loved her children very much - she would have done anything for them. When Patrick needed money for university, she tried to sell her belongings. She hoped that Carl would sort it out, but he failed to get money for his son, and Patrick was expelled.</string>
  <string id="14772">Rosa remembers that once she found him crying in the laundry room. It turned out that his girlfriend, Andrea Gorchik, and her whole family had been executed at the border.</string>
  <string id="14773">Rosa says that Martha was a sweet girl who loved candies as much as the next child. Once, she told everyone that brother had taken a pair of glasses belonging to Mark - Rosa’s husband, just so she could get candy. Mark was going to call the police!</string>
  <string id="14774">Talk to nice man</string>
  <string id="14775">This is Aloysius Shpak, a famous surgeon. He says that Carl helped him with his personal life. He lived in another building for a while, but then he came back.</string>
  <string id="14776">He says that Anna was a wonderful woman, but she had frail nerves. She died a month after they took Carl. Their children had already died by then.</string>
  <string id="14777">When they came to evict her, she shot Bruno Hempf, the big boss, right in the stomach. She got eleven shots in return.</string>
  <string id="14778">Aloysius remembers reading about a cave-in in the mine. More than 40 people died, including Patrick Stein. It was his first month of work. They brought Anna the death notice and her son's helmet. She fainted.</string>
  <string id="14779">Aloysius, with tears in his eyes, mentions that Carl’s daughter needed expensive foreign medicine called Liebespirit. And he couldn't help. Nobody could.</string>
  <string id="14780">Martha died. She used to say that she had a little sun inside her. That sun finally burned her. Aloysius starts weeping.</string>
  <string id="14781">You’ve heard all the stories there are to hear. The fate of the Stein family clearly left an impression on all these people. It's time to go home.</string>
  <string id="14782">-&gt;$11420</string>
  <string id="14783">You make several changes on public transport to get to the Certificate Issue Office. Stephen was right - the great building has no elevator, and breathless visitors have to climb the stairs to the upper floors.</string>
  <string id="14784">After standing in line, you meet the clerk who issues certificates. He asks you what your business is.</string>
  <string id="14785">Proof of disability</string>
  <string id="14786">You explain your problem. The clerk checks his papers and reports that the Ministry of Social Care has decided to provide disabled people with treatment in order to reduce costs.</string>
  <string id="14787">Right now there is an opportunity to get a referral for treatment at the Old Patriot sanatorium, where Stephen can get rid of his aneurysm completely!</string>
  <string id="14788">Get the Disability Certificate</string>
  <string id="14789">You disappoint the clerk, who seems to have his own quota to meet. He purses his lips, slaps a stamp on the document, slides it to you and shouts “Next!”.</string>
  <string id="14790">Well, that wasn't hard as Stephen said. You return home satisfied, certificate in hand.</string>
  <string id="14791">Get the referral for treatment</string>
  <string id="14792">Dawking will be surprised when he finds out he no longer needs to be afraid of sudden movements, climbing stairs and changes in elevation!</string>
  <string id="14793">You return home, happy to be able to help Stephen get better.</string>
  <string id="14794">Just talk</string>
  <string id="14795">-&gt;$7937</string>
  <string id="14796">The clerk points to a poster behind you: “Speak softly. Ask little. Get out fast.”</string>
  <string id="14797">Talk about bureaucracy</string>
  <string id="14799">-&gt;$14798</string>
  <string id="14800">Talk about diseases</string>
  <string id="14801">Talk about salary</string>
  <string id="14802">The clerk shouts “Next!”. You have to convince the next visitor to keep waiting in line, as you still haven’t got what you came for.</string>
  <string id="14803">-&gt;$11420</string>
  <string id="14804">You are standing at the end of Krushvice Street, in front of Lightenment Square. The Merchant Serena Marwitz mentioned is somewhere around here.</string>
  <string id="14805">Examine the Square</string>
  <string id="14806">Several streets lead out from the square.</string>
  <string id="14807">Turn left</string>
  <string id="14808">There are people in an alley selling vegetables from suburban farms. Some people still believe that vegetables from a garden are healthier than the food sets supplied by the Ministry of Social Care.</string>
  <string id="14809">Ask the vegetable sellers</string>
  <string id="14810">You try to find out where you can buy the things you need, but as soon as farmers realize that you don’t want to buy vegetables, they stop paying attention to you immediately.</string>
  <string id="14812">-&gt;$14811</string>
  <string id="14813">Turn right</string>
  <string id="14814">There are food stalls on this quiet street. Their range of products differs little from the state-owned stores, but the origin of the goods means that buyers can haggle.</string>
  <string id="14815">Go to the bookstore</string>
  <string id="14816">You push the locked doors several times without success.</string>
  <string id="14817">Go to the bakery</string>
  <string id="14818">The gray bread bricks on the counters don’t even smell like bread. They say that bread like this is little more than sawdust and glue from the furniture factories.</string>
  <string id="14819">Go to the butcher’s stall</string>
  <string id="14820">A fat salesman in a dirty robe stands over the empty counter. He looks bored as he tells you that all he has left is cat food.</string>
  <string id="14821">Buy cat food</string>
  <string id="14822">Now you have a whole can of high-quality cat food. This is a wise investment, considering that you do not have a pet.</string>
  <string id="14824">-&gt;$14823</string>
  <string id="14825">The only customer for the week has just left the shop. It's you.</string>
  <string id="14826">Go straight ahead</string>
  <string id="14827">You go into a blind alley. You can go into a courtyard through the gateway, but this hardly looks like a place for doing business.</string>
  <string id="14828">Go to the gateway</string>
  <string id="14829">A huge black-and-white cat lies in the middle of the gateway like it owns the place. It greets you with a disgruntled hiss. It arches its back, bristles its tail and yowls unpleasantly.</string>
  <string id="14830">Feed the cat</string>
  <string id="14831">The cat devours the food. Now you have a true friend in Helmer. Perhaps your only one.</string>
  <string id="14832">Purring after its lavish feast, the cat jumps into a narrow passage between the buildings which you hadn’t noticed before.</string>
  <string id="14833">The passage leads you to a parallel street where you spot a man in a top hat. He introduces himself as Nathan Kehler and is willing to trade.</string>
  <string id="14834">You have no food suitable for cats.</string>
  <string id="14835">Inspect the dead end</string>
  <string id="14836">There is only rubbish here. You wonder where it comes from in a time of such austerity.</string>
  <string id="14838">The wind blows rubbish around the Monument to Quote 4537 of the Wise Leader. The few passers-by try to hide from the drizzling rain and biting wind. The sound of music mingled with women’s laughter can be heard from the Righteous restaurant.</string>
  <string id="14839">Go to the monument</string>
  <string id="14840">The pigeons of Helmer clearly appreciate Quote 4537 of the Leader. That is plain to see.</string>
  <string id="14841">Go to the poster pillar</string>
  <string id="14842">Today, the junior medical staff orchestra of the district health department is performing a concert of patriotic music in the Small Hall of the Large Left Outhouse Building of the Central Municipal House of Popular Arts. Tickets have probably sold out already.</string>
  <string id="14843">Go to the restaurant</string>
  <string id="14844">Righteous is the place where the top ministers take a break from the troubles of governance. Mere mortals can only look through the windows and witness just how hard these officials need to relax after doing their duty to the Motherland.</string>
  <string id="14845">Go back home</string>
  <string id="14876">Sorry, regulations say that I have to get back to work.</string>

  <string id="15354">那你为什么坐在里面？</string>
  <string id="15355">那些该死的技术人员把机器拆开了，却无法再组装起来，所以现在我必须用手来操控这个雕像！感谢领袖，我不用学猫喵喵叫！我不能就这样离开，否则爪子会停止摆动!</string>

  <string id="15384">你真无知！你难道没有听说过华夏文化节？这座雕像就是为了纪念这个节日。</string>
  <string id="15385">为什么它一直在挥动爪子？</string>
  <string id="15386">我不知道，应该坏了吧。他们说这些雕像能为做生意的带来好运！</string>

  <string id="15395">那些提出令人不舒服和无聊问题的人将会得到不舒服的答复，并将被发配到铀矿工作！</string>
  <string id="15396">愿荣耀与我们伟大的国家和值得信赖的盟友华夏国之间的永恒联盟同在！愿和平与繁荣与两国同在！愿幸福、健康和福祉与我亲爱的市民同在！</string>

  <string id="1321">Summary of the incident:
Yesterday, as a result of gross safety violations while working with packaging materials, Ministry employees Hank and Rabindranath Wright lost their lives in a tragic accident.
A subsequent investigation found that Hank Wright and Rabindranath Wright had been stealing packaging materials from the trade pavilion on the waterfront. Strong winds caused the packaging wrap to unravel. The brothers got entangled in it, fell over, and rolled down the steep bank of the river - receiving multiple bruises, fractures, and deep penetrating wounds from tree branches and debris on the riverbank.
The Ministry of Information would like to remind you all of the need to comply with the law and all safety measures, and to kindly donate money for the funeral.</string>

  <string id="1868">Dear son. If you are reading this, I must already be dead. Forgive me for pushing you away, for the fact that we haven’t been as close these last few years as we used to be. You may not believe me, but this was my own unusual way of trying to protect you. Even my death serves this purpose - to protect my son... I don't know who else might read this letter, so I cannot risk telling you everything. Therefore, I have left everything important in special boxes throughout the Ministry. Only you can open them: the locks are coded to your biometrics. I hope you manage to put it all together and make the right decision in the end.

You should receive the first box along with this letter. You have to find the rest yourself. And, most importantly, don't trust anyone, Evan.
I wish I could bequeath you something more pleasant... 
Good luck and... I love you, son. </string>

This place can change anyone. Climbing up from the very bottom is just the first step towards making a difference... But I lost myself along the way... not completely, but some important, fundamental part of me slipped away like sand through my fingers. My humanity, perhaps?

Looking back, I often wonder about the ambitious young man I used to be, the man who came to work at the Ministry with the desire to help people - would he launch Heimdall? Or would he be horrified at the mere thought of doing such a thing to living people?
We will all burn in hell for it...</string>

The preparations took so many years, so much energy, so many sacrifices... The first trial run is in a month.
Our chance to change everything for the better will come to fruition in some 30 days. I can't believe it. And I'll finally get to see my son! Without having to fear for his life or those of his family.

But it's too early to daydream and celebrate this victory. There is still much I still have to check. The important thing is to make sure that the signal stability doesn’t violate the alpha rhythms at 9 Hz...</string>
  <string id="1871">&lt;i&gt;Torn diary page&lt;/i&gt;

Alpha rhythms are considered to be absent in people with congenital blindness or atrophy of the optic nerve. This issue became crucial when DeSalvo, along with Weinberg, suggested issuing all blind citizens with tickets for the Blissful Sleep. Curse them! This project was developed to ensure that no one else had to die! Thank god that the latest data came in, proving that alpha rhythms aren't the main indicator of a recipient's sensitivity...

But I was impressed once again by how easily they can solve any difficulties! No man, no problem! It’s disgusting.
Another reason to think about restricting access to the control terminal.</string>

02.21.1982
Test subject: Stefania Ike, age 32
Rejection signal of 20 uV amplitude is indicated as (N).
&lt;start of fragment&gt;
Researcher (shows a picture of a child): What do you see?
Ike: A girl of about five with red ribbons in her hair. She’s sitting in a chair and smiling. It’s a nice photo.
Researcher: What do you feel when you look at it?
Ike: I feel comfort. I feel that this photo was taken with love.
Researcher (N): Take another look. What do you see?
Ike (gulps): Is that a different photo? It’s a disgusting... I can't call it a child... a gnome... grinning, lounging in a chair. 
Researcher: What do you feel?
Ike (quite nervous): Is this some kind of joke? Why are you asking such stupid questions?! Take it away... before I throw up on your shoes!
Researcher (return -N): Are you sure?
Ike (shakes her head, discouraged, eyes unfocused, breathing heavily): What? Did you ask me something? (pause) How did I get here? Why am I... 
&lt;end of fragment&gt;</string>

The closer the work gets to completion, the more the situation heats up. I cannot shake the feeling of an approaching thunderstorm: the very air seems to be electrified. Yesterday there was another failed attempt on Weinberg’s life. And Ferguson doesn't even bother to hide his disappointment about it. They're like a pack of dogs fighting over a bone hanging above their heads. 

All I have to do is to immerse myself in work like Hemnitz and ignore what’s happening. Sometimes I remind myself that an ostrich that tries to bury its head in the sands of the Ministry might end up hitting it against the concrete floor... But I must finish this project. Then I’ll have my chance of redemption...</string>
  <string id="1874">&lt;i&gt;Torn diary page&lt;/i&gt;

We've spent so much time studying the immunity of the blind to our signal that we've become blind ourselves. It was so obvious! Heimdall... doesn't make corrections, as we thought it did. It doesn't fix things the way we... the way I... had hoped. It suppresses, entirely replaces the subject with itself, leaving no memory of the signal!
It's so hideous that I can't find the proper words. This changes everything! 

Handing it over to the Inner Circle is the same as allowing a pyromaniac to drive a train with high-octane fuel tanks into a volcano...
Today I locked the system to the central terminal and blocked access to everyone except myself. I'll make my last attempt this evening. 5 uV may be less destructive... but there's little hope left...
</string>
  <string id="1875">&lt;i&gt;Torn diary page&lt;/i&gt;

I don’t have time to destroy everything. They'll be able to restore it from the backup copies... But I've still done something!
I have completely changed the login procedure. Now, it’s not just bound to a specific individual’s biometrics - most functions can only be activated using encryption keys. I’d like to see them try to collect all the Heimdall codes. Hah! 
Only one person can get them. 

I try to convince myself that these boxes aren’t just an old man’s desperate attempt to stall them for a while. It’s a small sliver of a shot at making things right.
And this has to be done using... my blood, my genes, my heir, my son. Evan will be the one to make the choice. By himself.
I'm a damn coward for shifting the responsibility to my child...
</string>
  <string id="1876">&lt;i&gt;Torn diary page&lt;/i&gt;

The Inner Circle. Who came up with such a name for the handful of people running the country, hiding behind the image of the Wise Leader?
 
I often asked this question at first, but then realized that there was as much sense to it as there is in the appeals of citizens coming to the Ministry.
Because the Inner Circle doesn’t include a single honest person... I used to think that one of them was trustworthy. 
But he turned out to be the most cunning and slippery of them all. I sometimes even doubt whether he’s human at all.</string>
  <string id="1877">&lt;i&gt;Profile: P. Ferguson&lt;/i&gt;

Extremely unreliable, lazy and stupid.
Addicted to alcohol and drugs.
Constantly takes bribes in huge amounts and holds orgies in the Ministry. A regular client of illegal brothels. 
Repeatedly accused of abusing minors, but all charges were dropped due to pressure on witnesses.
Considering the above and attaching full case details, I recommend limiting P. Ferguson’s authority to Floor 1 of the Ministry. 

I also recommend awarding him the Order of Merit to the Motherland to reduce his indignation about “permanent unjustified distrust”.

(C. Redgrave)</string>
  <string id="1878">Bruno, my friend! You have to help me! That son of bitch, that shithead Redgrave! I saw an internal memo he wrote about me! Now I’ve calmed down a bit, so I'm writing to you. I can't call you - I smashed the phone against the wall. That prick has pissed me off! 

We need to do something about him. Otherwise, he'll pull the plug and we'll have no more music, champagne, caviar or pineapples. No more parties. I don't know about you, Bruno, but I can't live without sweet, easy, slutty girls! So, use your connections - let's find some dirt on this worthless moralist!</string>
  <string id="1879">&lt;i&gt;Profile: A. DeSalvo&lt;/i&gt;

Extremely cruel and cold-blooded. Quick-minded. Highly dangerous both inside and outside the Ministry.
His “experiments” and “curiosity” are indicative of his psychotic nature. I recommend an urgent psychiatric evaluation which will unquestionably lead to his removal from office, together with complete social isolation and compulsory treatment.

Prior psychiatric evaluations have been hampered by the recurring disappearances of medical specialists sent to DeSalvo.
A compulsory psychiatric investigation conducted by I.I.D. agents is recommended.

Subject: Re: Hideous experiments
Caleb, I don't quite understand the point of your claims. If I didn't already know that you're devoted to the ideals of our Great Society, I would think that you’re defending the very public enemies whom I'm trying to correct. That can't be the case, can it, Caleb? I’m sure you’re no traitor. Perhaps we should talk in person somewhere without surveillance - so as not to be bound by the official rules of correspondence. I know the perfect place for us to talk openly... Come to my office for a cup of tea and I'll show you.

From: C. Redgrave
Subject: Hideous experiments
Albert, I doubt that this letter will make you change your mind. I don’t believe that you can stop yourself anymore. But I have to try...
Your activities in your “secret chamber” have long since gone beyond the definition of evil. Words can't begin to describe. I’m begging you in a desperate attempt to save some of these poor victims. Come to your senses!
Stop these horrible experiments!</string>
  <string id="1881">&lt;i&gt;Profile: Isaac Weinberg&lt;/i&gt;

Talented and very smart. Obsessed with utopian ideas of the perfect world.
Incredibly hard-working, but becomes completely impervious to external stimuli when immersed in his work. Thus, he may come across as absent-minded, untidy and unhygienic. But this is misleading. 
He is soft, yet uncompromising.
He exhibits absolute commitment and polite integrity bordering on madness.

I recommend...
Damn it! To be honest, I don't know why I'm writing these profiles. All this bureaucracy gets so deep into our veins, mixes with our blood, that it becomes part of our metabolism.
Each member of the Inner Circle is, in fact, at the very top. All these profiles and recommendations are useless... Simply an acquired reflex!
I'm afraid that sooner or later this nonsense will become a set of instinctive reflexes that we pass down to our children and grandchildren...</string>
  <string id="1882">&lt;i&gt;Fragment of Wolf and Stein 2.0 workshop transcript&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;...&gt;
Redgrave: Are you sure this is necessary? This man had a family!
Weinberg: You know my stance: anything for the greatest common good. It's wise to sacrifice one person so that the species can survive.
Redgrave: Survival of the species is no longer your goal. Don't delude yourself, Isaac - you’re after a lot more.
Weinberg: I don't see development as a bad thing. This is evolution, albeit artificial, accelerated, and man-made. But nature is too slow, and often gives us the species best adapted to a specific habitat. I want the habitat to adapt to the new species.
Redgrave: But we're talking about individuality! 
Weinberg: You’re for freedom of choice, aren’t you? So, let me remind you: this man made his choice. Thus, it fits in with your value system, Caleb...
&lt;...&gt;</string>
  <string id="1883">I want to apologize to you, Evan. I was a bad father. I wasn't with you when you needed me. I'm not with you now, when you’re caught in the center of this whirlpool of shit, the fight for power in the Inner Circle. And you're here because of me. My ambitions and irrepressible, selfish thirst for justice put your life in danger. Don't indulge in illusions, son. The Ministry is a hole, a black hole that sucks out your soul and pulls it into the heart of the storm, a world of perverted notions of good and evil.

But I'm not apologizing for what I've done. 
No. I just hope that you'll be able to forgive me for what you've done - or still have to do. I'm very sorry.</string>
  <string id="1884">This is an appeal to you, my son. I don’t know if you’ll ever read it. Perhaps this confession of mine is in vain... But I have to tell you my most terrible secret.
Your mother... I killed her. No, I didn’t pull a trigger or anything like that. But it was me who signed the circular authorizing the use of pesticides in fruit groves. She was killed by my indifference and my willingness to make compromises with my conscience. The day she died, I was supposed to pick her up from work... But I was too busy, had so many important things to do... 

If I had wanted to turn my back on this career in the Ministry, I could have easily gotten a referral to another good job anywhere in the country. I often tried to make excuses, thinking that without me, those villains at the top would tear our country apart... But that’s all it is - an excuse... I was the unprincipled fool who authorized the poisoning of the population...
And your mother only bought those apples from some old woman because she was kind wanted to support a pensioner. Every day I thank heaven that you were at summer camp at the time.
...All the subsequent “prohibitions” on apple sales were my desperate attempts to atone, and they changed nothing...</string>
  <string id="1885">I remember the day your mother and I went to the coast. Everything changed when you were born, but back then we still had a coast not poisoned by fuel from sunken military tankers. Without the burned corpses of young soldiers, both ours and Boreans, who died in that senseless war.

On that sunny day, your mother and I drank three bottles of wine, swam until it got cold, and then warmed ourselves up in each other’s arms under a large woolen blanket. I remember that day as clearly as if it was yesterday. Because the day we conceived you is the second happiest day of my life. The first one is the day you were born.</string>
  <string id="1886">&lt;i&gt;Diary page&lt;/i&gt;

That image, created before our birth, was developed down to the finest detail. He wears a military uniform because he is always ready to defend his homeland, but the uniform is always blindingly white, without a single speck. His cap makes him look more courageous, and the ribbon with the coat of arms marks him as the true son of the State - as the Commander-in-Chief should be. But the most insidious part is the mustache. 
There's something soft and cozy in it. He looks like a father, an uncle, an older brother, a teacher or a best friend. Without the mustache, he doesn't look wise. The mustache makes him trustworthy.</string>
  <string id="1887">James was a good man. He was so reliable and strong that you felt confident in yourself when he was nearby.
I'm very sad that we aren't as close friends as before. My distrust probably applies to everyone now. He’s given me no reason for it, but my persecution complex manages to find suspicious details everywhere - in every phrase and look.

As they say: just because you’re paranoid doesn't mean they aren’t after you. And it seems to me that his sincere desire to help and to uncover the Inner Circle is hiding something else. Someone else, to be precise. Someone at the top of the I.I.D. is digging around for the Inner Circle. Though I wish to hold all my “colleagues” to account, the presence of one more piece on the chessboard frightens me. That's why I don’t trust James.</string>
  <string id="1888">Hemnitz is exceptional with numbers, and he is truly passionate about this job. When I brought him in on the Heimdall project, I couldn't even imagine what a valuable asset he would become.

I told him many times that his talent was wasted on the first floor, and that he should work with statistics. He just smiled in response. Sometimes he seems to be the only one I can trust... If I didn't know who he really was and what he was capable of, I would befriend with him without hesitation.</string>
